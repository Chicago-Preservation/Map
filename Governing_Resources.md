Preservation efforts rely on a network of governing bodies, regulatory frameworks, and evaluation criteria that determine how historic sites are designated, documented, and maintained. This page serves as a reference for the major governing resources in historic preservation, providing insight into what each entity does, what it does and does not regulate, financial assistance programs, and step-by-step application processes.
