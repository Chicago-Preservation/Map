## Defining Boundaries: Why Are We Using Community Areas?

Chicago’s spatial boundaries can be defined in multiple ways, each serving different analytical and policy-related purposes. To ensure consistency in research and historical analysis, we prioritize **Community Areas** over other boundary systems.
>
### Community Areas
- A historically stable framework for analysis. Established in the 1920s by the **University of Chicago’s Social Science Research Committee**, these divisions have remained **unchanged over time**, making them valuable for **longitudinal studies and comparative research**. 
>
**[View Community Areas (77 total)](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6)**  
>
### Wards
-  Represent **political districts**, each electing a representative to the **Chicago City Council**. Ward boundaries are **periodically adjusted** following the **U.S. Census** to reflect population changes, ensuring equitable representation but making them **less consistent for historical and spatial analysis**.

>
### Neighborhoods
-   Socially and culturally defined areas, shaped by **community identity, historical shifts, and urban development**. Unlike community areas and wards, **neighborhood boundaries are not officially recognized** and can vary depending on the source.

While **Community Areas** provide the most reliable framework for research, we acknowledge that **political boundaries, cultural landscapes, and evolving neighborhood identities** are integral to understanding **Chicago’s development**.

## Land Acknowledgment 
>
Chicago stands on the ancestral homelands of the Council of the Three Fires- the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations- as well as the Miami, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac, Fox, Peoria, Kaskaskia, Wea, Kickapoo, and Mascouten Nations.
>
Indigenous peoples were the first preservationists, safeguarding the land through sustainable stewardship, cultural traditions, and knowledge systems passed down for generations. Their histories, resilience, and contributions continue to shape this region today.
>
Chicago remains home to a thriving Indigenous community, with Native people from many tribal nations enriching the city’s cultural and historical fabric. We honor and acknowledge all Native peoples- past, present, and future- who have shaped and continue to shape this land.
