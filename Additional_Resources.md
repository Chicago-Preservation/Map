#### Defining Boundaries: Why Are We Using Community Areas?
>
<p> Chicago’s spatial boundaries can be defined in multiple ways, each serving different analytical and policy-related purposes. To ensure consistency in research and historical analysis, we prioritize Community Areas over other boundary systems. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong> <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6" target="_blank"> Community Areas </a> (77 total) are a historically stable framework for analysis. Created in the 1920s by the University of Chicago’s Social Science Research Committee, these divisions remain unchanged over time, making them valuable for longitudinal studies and comparative research</strong>.</li> 

<li><strong><a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Wards-2015-2023-/sp34-6z76" target="_blank"> Wards </a> (50 total) represent political districts, each electing a representative to the Chicago City Council. Ward boundaries are periodically adjusted following the U.S. Census to reflect population changes, ensuring equitable representation but making them less consistent for historical and spatial analysis</strong>.</li> 

<li><strong><a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Neighborhoods/bbvz-uum9" target="_blank"> Neighborhoods </a> are socially and culturally defined areas, shaped by community identity, historical shifts, and urban development. Unlike community areas and wards, neighborhood boundaries are not officially recognized and can vary depending on the source</strong>.</li> 
</ul>

<p>While Community Areas provide the most reliable framework for research, we acknowledge that political boundaries, cultural landscapes, and evolving neighborhood identities are integral to understanding Chicago’s development.</p>
