## Defining Boundaries: Why Are We Using Community Areas?

Chicago’s spatial boundaries can be defined in multiple ways, each serving different analytical and policy-related purposes. To ensure consistency in research and historical analysis, we prioritize **Community Areas** over other boundary systems.

### Community Areas
- A historically stable framework for analysis. Established in the 1920s by the **University of Chicago’s Social Science Research Committee**, these divisions have remained **unchanged over time**, making them valuable for **longitudinal studies and comparative research**.

### Wards
-  Represent **political districts**, each electing a representative to the **Chicago City Council**. Ward boundaries are **periodically adjusted** following the **U.S. Census** to reflect population changes, ensuring equitable representation but making them **less consistent for historical and spatial analysis**.

### Neighborhoods
-   Socially and culturally defined areas, shaped by **community identity, historical shifts, and urban development**. Unlike community areas and wards, **neighborhood boundaries are not officially recognized** and can vary depending on the source.

While **Community Areas** provide the most reliable framework for research, we acknowledge that **political boundaries, cultural landscapes, and evolving neighborhood identities** are integral to understanding **Chicago’s development**.

## Land Acknowledgment 

"The City of Chicago is located on land that is and has long been a center for Native peoples. The area is the traditional homelands of the Anishinaabe, or the Council of the Three Fires: the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations. Many other Nations consider this area their traditional homeland, including the Myaamia, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac and Fox, Peoria, Kaskaskia, Wea, Kickapoo, and Mascouten. The City specifically acknowledges the contributions of Kitihawa of the Potawatomi in fostering the community that has become Chicago. We acknowledge all Native peoples who came before us and who continue to contribute to our City. We are committed to promoting Native cultural heritage."
