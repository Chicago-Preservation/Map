  <strong>We’re committed to making Mapping Chicago Preservation a valuable and evolving resource.</strong> We recognize that digital platforms require ongoing maintenance, updates, and sustainable infrastructure, yet resources for long-term preservation and accessibility remain a challenge across digital humanities initiatives. While we strive to maintain accuracy and relevance, this platform is a work in progress. Some datasets may be incomplete or require updates over time, and we welcome feedback, collaboration, and contributions to enhance the project’s longevity.
</p>

<p>
  We invite you to complete a brief survey (estimated completion time: 5–7 minutes) to provide feedback on the platform’s usability, accessibility, and overall effectiveness. Your insights will directly inform efforts to enhance the platform’s value for a broad range of users.
