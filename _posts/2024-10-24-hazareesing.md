#### MONUMENT
The bas-reliefs are figurative, depicting key historical moments through human figures and scenes. The compositions are heavily centered around by idealized European settler figures. For example, in The Pioneers panel, settlers are shown with weapons and tools, symbolizing their control over the landscape and Indigenous peoples. These scenes, while intended to commemorate the founding of the city, are deeply rooted in colonial imagery, where European figures are portrayed as creators of "civilization" taming a wild and hostile land. The settlers are also shown standing tall or marching forward, reflecting dominance and purpose. This figurative approach serves to dehumanize any Indigenous figures included, often reducing them to passive roles or portraying them as obstacles to progress, rather than as integral parts of Chicago’s early history.

In The Defense panel, settlers are depicted holding rifles, a symbol of power and conquest. This use of weaponry suggests not only physical dominance but also moral righteousness, as if their acts of violence were necessary and justified in the service of "progress." Tools such as plows and axes are also present, which reinforce the theme of European settlers as civilizing forces taming the land. These tools symbolize industry, work ethic, and the transformation of the "wilderness" into a city, yet they ignore the pre-existing Indigenous communities (Powatomi) and culture present at that time already. Once again, whilst the monument does portray Indigenous peoples in some panels, their presence is minimal and can be be seen as demeaning. They are often shown in submissive postures or as background figures, reflecting colonial narratives of Indigenous peoples as obstacles to be overcome or as passive witnesses to European superiority.

Moreover, the sculptures themselves contain very minimal textual inscriptions, relying heavily on the imagery to convey their message. The absence of text allows the viewer’s understanding to be shaped almost entirely by the visual narrative, leaving little room for alternative interpretations of the events depicted. The omission of critical historical facts, for example the forced removal of the Potawatomi people from the region also shapes the viewer’s perception. Without text to provide context or counter-narratives, the bas-reliefs become an unchallenged assertion of the righteousness of settler colonialism, further solidifying the monument in ideologies of white supremacy and imperialism.

The bas-relief sculptures on DuSable Bridge are crafted from limestone, a traditional material commonly used for monumental art. Limestone’s durability and permanence can reflect the intended long lasting values and historical narratives which have been enshrined in the monument. The choice of stone over more modern or industrial materials, such as steel or concrete, highlights the monument’s connection with classical traditions of commemoration, which often focuses on glorifying figures from history using natural, timeless materials. 


#### COUNTER-MONUMENT
These countermonument images directly challenge the triumphant story often tied to Chicago's founding, like what’s depicted in monuments such as "The Pioneer" bas-relief on the DuSable Bridge. That kind of portrayal usually glorifies the settlers, presenting them as heroes who bravely established the city. But the reality is different: Chicago’s growth came at a high cost, particularly for Indigenous peoples, who were displaced as settlers moved in. This countermonument refuses to accept that simplified story of heroism, focusing instead on the oppression and injustices that played a significant part in building the city.

The visuals make this point clear by contrasting the dark, somber images of colonial settlers with the bright, vivid depictions of Indigenous resilience. This contrast highlights how Native peoples have often been erased and marginalized in mainstream history. The broken chains and displaced homes in the background are a reminder of the violence and trauma that accompanied Chicago’s development. At the same time, the vibrant and strong Indigenous figures in the foreground represent survival, strength, and ongoing resistance against a legacy of exclusion. These images push viewers to think twice about who the true heroes are in Chicago’s history and to face the deep injustices that lie beneath the city's origins.

Working with AI in this countermonument project presented unique challenges, particularly in communicating a nuanced critique of history. One of the biggest hurdles was the need to be extremely literal in describing concepts and themes. AI tends to interpret terms at face value, which made it necessary to clearly specify details that might be more intuitively understood by a human. For instance, when I initially referenced the "real narrative" of Chicago’s founding, the AI defaulted to the mainstream version that celebrates the settlers’ triumph rather than focusing on the more critical story of Indigenous displacement and marginalization. This meant that I had to carefully navigate the language, ensuring that each element of the design was explicitly described to convey the intended meaning. It was crucial to clearly articulate that the goal was to critique the colonialist perspective, rather than reinforce it, which often involved unpacking complex ideas into simple, direct instructions for the AI.
