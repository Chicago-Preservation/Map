desc: "What makes a Historical figure? How do the symbols of the time affect their telling of the past? Abraham Lincoln the Man shows the many layers of that topic. It is a symptom of its time, though still a  monument to the president who represents our state, ended slavery and saved our nation."

#### MONUMENT
The Abraham Lincoln the Man statue is 12 feet tall, standing in Lincoln Park and entirely bronze. This bronze material has historically conveyed wealth and nobility. This emphasis of the nobility can also be seen in the inclusion of the throne with the statue, which includes an eagle on it. This symbol of the United States historically has also been linked to many European monarchies. Though the bald eagle specifically is American, the eagle has been the symbol of many royal houses such as the Habsburgs and Romanovs. Between the throne and the eagle the statue conveys the idea of an American Empire. The time period (the late 19th century) was a time period when America increasingly exerted imperialist influence abroad while solidifying its colonization of the west at the end of the Westward Expansion. Through choice of material and these symbols of the American Empire the statue conveys an image that enforces outdated notions of the United States and conveys a revisionary view of Lincoln as an imperial figure. Sitting behind the Chicago Historic society in Lincoln Park with seating built into the monument itself and a garden area to look upon from it, the monument was clearly meant not to just be seen by passers by but by large groups of people close up. This fact is why the addition of the throne and the eagle which are less noticeable from afar are so important. The designer wanted his target audience (Chicago when it was a growing industrial hub filled with european immigrants) to associate the ideas it shows as representative of the country as it came to solidify its identity. Also notable in its history is that the sculptor was a European and implemented some motifs from the imperialist he came from. This may be part of the reason so many imperial symbols are present on the monument. Though the sculptor may be part of the reason, the consistent use of eagles and other imperial symbols was prevalent at the time both to glorify the US (such as the use of the Eagle in the colonial crest of the US Filipino Government) and mock it. 

This is a picture of Standing Lincoln, preserved by the Lincoln collection. Present in this picture is Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the sculptor of the work. One thing to note is that he attempts to both humanize Lincoln and glorify him from a European perspective, which is significant in the analysis of his presentation of the president. Also shown in this historic photograph is how larger-than-life Lincoln appears in the monument, both in presentation and literally in size.

This is a photo of the monument. Behind Lincoln is a throne adorned with symbols from America during the late 18th century. One example is the massive eagle right behind Lincoln, which has historically been linked to monarchy. In this context, the eagle has particularly been associated with empires usually somehow linking to the Romans (though the symbol is much older). During this time period, this symbol was used by royals such as the Czars to indicate a connection to monarchy and the imperial past. The double-headed eagle symbol originated in the Byzantine Empire during the Palaiologos dynasty to represent a dual perspective of looking East and West. This also relates to the U.S. during this time, as it was focused both on industrialization in the East and on the West, where the last remnants of Native American resistance were being crushed and western tribes were forced onto reservations. This symbol represents a more imperial view of the United States that does not necessarily align with either the country today or with the narrative of Lincoln.

#### "REBEL ARCHIVE"
Coloniality as a pattern of power resulting from colonialism is evident throughout the Lincoln monument. At face value, and considering the timing of its creation, this becomes clear. The monument was erected during America's transition from 19th-century continental westward expansion to early 20th-century overseas imperialism. In attempting to depict a flawed yet beloved figure, the sculptor presents a narrative of a bygone era. Standing Lincoln is intended to symbolize the people of Chicago at that time, those engaged in "Americanizing," and in doing so, it imparts both the mythos of Lincoln and the values of coloniality. Furthermore the Standing Lincoln monument coincides with an era when the United States was building its identity on the backs of those conquered. The legacy of the Mexican-American War resonates in the imagery of Lincoln, seated on a throne that unites a nation. As America sought to extend its influence beyond its borders, the Lincoln monument romanticized a past that conveniently aligned with colonial ambitions, glossing over the complexities of conquest and displacement. In this way, it reinforced a narrative that celebrated settlement while obscuring the realities of those displaced in the pursuit of national expansion.

In contrast to the Lincoln monument, the cartoon by PUNCH magazine offers a critical perspective on American imperialism and its associated iconography. It depicts a violent, somewhat out-of-control American eagle—echoing the same symbol seen on Lincoln's throne—charging forward to conquer new lands. Although the cartoonists of the time may not have shared contemporary views on imperialism, their role as outside observers allowed them to provide keen commentary on American actions. While the study of coloniality was not yet formalized, the cartoon illustrates how symbols can be corrupted by imperial ambitions. Both the eagle and the American symbols, such as Uncle Sam’s outfit, traditionally represent freedom; however, in this portrayal, they are transformed into the personification of imperialism. While the Lincoln monument accepts these symbols uncritically, reflecting a more romanticized view, the PUNCH cartoon engages in a critical dialogue about their evolving meanings in the context of imperial expansion. Though not intended, it creates a polar opposite to the reverence seen in standing Lincoln to Lincoln the man yes, but also the broader imperialist America at the time.

This is a depiction of the American Eagle symbol by Punch magazine, a publication based in London known for popularizing the term "cartoon" during the 19th century. Though their cartoon originates from another culture of imperialism, viewing it from an outside lens allows them to craft a stark image of the American ideal. In this cartoon, an American eagle dressed as Uncle Sam is dragging President McKinley into the Spanish-American War. This war occurred a decade after the unveiling of the monument, and the same symbols from it, such as the stars and bald eagle, are warped to symbolize imperialism and bloodlust to someone observing American culture from the outside.

#### COUNTER-MONUMENT
In my ChatGPT counter monument project, I set out to correct the colonial and somewhat regal elements present in the Standing Lincoln Monument and create a modern counter-monument to it. For my version of Standing Lincoln, my primary focus was on removing imperialist symbols, specifically the throne and the American eagle. I also aimed to correct previous narratives that glorified imperialism during that time period and afterward. In my experience, I found that it wasn't research or academia that posed the primary challenge, but rather the limitations and ingrained coloniality of ChatGPT’s image database.

My intended design for my counter-monument would have two main components. The first focuses on what Lincoln is rising from. In the original, he rises from a bronze throne adorned with symbols that reflect coloniality. Although the American eagle has various meanings for many Americans, it, especially the one present on the current statue is tied to the colonial history of the period when the monument was created. This symbol was used in American colonization efforts, such as the American-Filipino colonial coat of arms, and was seen as a symbol of American imperialism in political cartoons from that era, which I found in my rebel archive. The throne itself, naturally, is associated with monarchy, and the bronze material suggests both an imperial and unchanging nature. To reflect a more modern view of history and to distance a statue of a democratically elected American president from those monarchical overtones, I planned to change the material to wood—specifically, white oak, which is our state tree. This choice further emphasizes Lincoln’s connection to our state's history, a relationship that the current monument tries to convey by placing it outside the historical society and having Lincoln look toward Chicago. This change would allow the monument to evolve while maintaining its purpose. The second part of my monument plan was to incorporate a reference to the Dakota Massacre. I intended to do this by using either the Lakota Sioux symbol—the spider or their depiction of an eagle—along with an inscription.

This counter-monument of Abraham Lincoln alters the imperialist imagery used by the first monument by presenting a simplified design and a change in material. Lincoln stands in his typical dignified stance, but instead of a bronze throne, he is accompanied by a plain wooden chair, emphasizing the shift in how history is viewed and stripping away the traditional regal symbols of power found on the throne. Notably, the previously prominent American eagle motif is entirely absent, replaced by natural, unadorned wood. The monument continues to exist outside the historic narrative, reflecting Chicago's landscape and encouraging viewers to engage with a version of history that looks past the revisionism of earlier generations.

This ChatGPT-generated counter-monument reimagines the traditional Standing Lincoln statue by incorporating a forgotten Indigenous perspective. The bronze figure of Lincoln stands in a dignified pose, accompanied by a wooden Civil War-era chair with a Sioux symbol carved into the backrest, replacing the traditional American eagle to critique imperialism. It’s important to note that the American eagle was intended to be entirely removed—a task that ChatGPT was unable to fully accomplish.
A plaque in the foreground explains the connection between the American eagle and its role in U.S. expansionism, while another plaque honors the Sioux who suffered during the 1862 massacre. This second plaque illustrates the use of the bald eagle in iconography both before the statue's construction, such as on American military equipment during the Mexican-American War, and afterward, like the American coat of arms used during the occupation of the Philippines. The monument is situated next to the Chicago Historical Society, looking out over the city.

#### REFLECTIONS ON AI
Ultimately, while my work in conceptualizing a counter-monument was successful, creating that counter-monument using ChatGPT presented unexpected challenges. The main challenge was the ingrained coloniality present in ChatGPT's database. I repeatedly asked it to remove the American eagle, using phrases like "keep everything the same but remove the eagle" and specifying prompts with no eagles at all. Despite my clear instructions, ChatGPT consistently included American eagles, each progressively infused with more turn-of-the-century imperialist undertones—even though I hadn't referenced that time period. Eventually, I asked why it kept including the eagles and whether it was due to an inherent colonial bias. Surprisingly, ChatGPT responded with a detailed explanation of how coloniality could influence its outputs—only to generate yet another image with an eagle. This experience, while fascinating, highlighted the limitations of AI. A chatbot is only as effective as its database, and ChatGPT still carries the undertones, symbols, cultural dominance, and ideologies of colonialism, reflecting how coloniality persists in the present.
