>There was an abundance of new homes and churches built after Cortez conquered the Aztec empire. It was necessary for the Spanish to preserve the Aztec culture in these new types of architecture in order to keep the Aztecs around (Rebolledo, 1998, 11). Consequently, it is very common to find traces of Aztec culture in many of the designs we see today, specifically in vecindades and hacienda. A key feature in Aztec and Spanish culture was the patio, a place providing extra space that created a communal and democratic environment.

>The vecindad has four components that makes its design particular. The first component is the zahuan, the entrance to the vecindad. Its purpose is similar to that of a corridor with a few unique differences. It is likely to find a religious piece in the zahuan, like a Virgin Mary or a Saint (Lewis 1958, 5). The zahuan is generally a place with very little light inside it, allowing a visible transition between the outside and the inside of the vecindad (Rebolledo, 1998, 24). The zahuan leads to the patio. The patio is large enough to allow the socialization of the occupants in the vecindad. It was a space for both the children and adults: the children gathered here to play and the adults gathered here to fulfill their labor (Rebolledo, 1998, 4). The patio was surrounded by dwellings, some one story and others two stories (Rebolledo, 1998, 5). The dwellings included a small kitchen and a sleeping area. Although many of the newer vecindades include a restroom, it was common to find a restroom outside the dwellings, to be shared by all the neighbors (Rebolledo, 1998, 5). Lastly, there were the accesorias. The accesorias also offered a space for business and money making and were found surrounding the dwellings, towards the outside of the vecindad (Rebolledo, 1998, 15).

>In essence, the design of these vecindades was also influenced by the fear of the Spanish colonizers. They wanted to create an enclosed area that protected them from potential attacks from indigenous people as it was something they had experienced before (Messina 2005 ,19).

A vecindad is shown. This image shows the lack of light in the zahuan: it is narrow and dark. There are images hanging on the wall. An older lady is carrying a basket, there are stairs that lead to the top floor of the vecindad. There are clothes hung across the patio, showing the labor the women had to fulfill. The patio is small but allows for the communication of the people and is also shown at the center, with dwellings surrounding it.

This image shows La Vecindad from a famous spanish sitcom 'El Chavo Del Ocho.' There are clothes hanging to dry in the patio, where a bicycle is shown indicating a play area for the children. The patio is surrounded by buildings and contains a pila, a very common sink area used to wash clothes and dishes in Mexico. The zahuan is slightly pictured but its arch in the wall shows its similarity to a corridor.
