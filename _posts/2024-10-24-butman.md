"The Regeneration Monument on Chicago's DuSable Bridge (formerly Michigan Avenue Bridge) commemorates the rebuilding of Chicago after the Great Fire of 1871, which devastated much of the city. The devastating fire leveled over 3 square miles of the city and left around 100,000 residents homeless. The fire, which occurred in October 1871, was a pivotal event in the city's history, ultimately leading to a massive reconstruction effort that transformed Chicago into a modern urban center and one of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S. The Regeneration Monument celebrates the city's resilience and progress in the face of destruction.The monument has faced controversy over time due to the way indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups are depicted. Specifically,critics argue that the relief—while celebrating Chicago's industrial and economic progress—tends marginalize or oversimplify the city's Native American history.

"While the relief features a central female figure symbolizing the city, surrounded by figures of workers and builders enaged in rebuilding the city, While it celebrates the resilience and progress of Chicago, the monument overlooks the contributions of women, immigrants, African Americans, and Indigenous peoples in this pivotal period. "
"Note the depiction of only male laborers of seeming Western European descent."

"The DuSable Bridge wascompleted in 1920, connecting Chicago’s north and south sides along Michigan Avenue. While it is a feat of engineering achievement, its Birdgehouse sculptures celebrate early European explorers and the city’s rebuilding after the Great Fire. However, the underrepresentation of Indigenous people and DuSable, whose small monument contrasts with the grand Eurocentric sculptures, has sparked ongoing debates about historical inclusivity."

"The map of downtown Chicago after the Great Fire of 1871 illustrates the city's rapid reconstruction, showcasing urban planning advancements and reflecting the remarkable transformation that occurred in the wake of devastation. This period was significant as it allowed for new architectural styles and infrastructure to support a burgeoning population, ultimately establishing Chicago as a major urban center and hub of economic growth. However, the map also highlights the controversy surrounding the rebuilding efforts, as it neglects to represent the contributions of women, immigrants, African Americans, and Indigenous peoples, who played essential roles in the recovery. Instead, the narrative often focuses on the achievements of white male entrepreneurs and architects, contributing to a historical account that overlooks the cultural contributions and histories of diverse communities. Additionally, the reconstruction frequently led to the displacement of poorer neighborhoods, particularly those inhabited by marginalized populations, prioritizing commercial development over housing. As a result, the map symbolizes not only the city's resilience and ambition but also the complexities and social inequities that emerged during this transformative period."

This map shows the many Indian trails and villages in the Chicago region, highlighting the locations of Native American settlements and trade routes that predate the city's establishment. Indigenous peoples, including the Potawatomi, Miami, and Illinois tribes, used these trails (marked in red) and waterways (in blue) for trade, travel, and communication. Many of the Native villages (green areas) were located along key rivers and lakes, making the region a significant crossroads for trade. When Chicago was built and rebuilt, much of the city's infrastructure, including major roads like Ogden and Archer Avenues, was developed directly over these ancient trails, while Native American villages and mounds were destroyed or forgotten. This map underscores how modern Chicago was constructed over a rich Indigenous history, much of which has been erased or overlooked as the city expanded.
#### Arguments For Preservation
- Some defenders of the monument suggest that Regeneration’s inclusion on that list for demoliton was mostly collateral damage, guilt-by-association. In recommending the bridgehouse reliefs for removal, the commission pointed to their imperialist triumphalism, depicting Native Americans only as tools to define the heroic acts and qualities of colonizers. They claim Regeneration, is an innocent representation of men rebuilding the burning city around the  personification of Chicago. They claim "It’s hard to see how that conveys a narrative of Western colonial triumph, besides its proximity to and relationship with the other three."

- The Bridgehouse Museum states that due to its long history, the bridge along with its bridgehouses, was designated a Chicago Landmark in 1991 by the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois making the process for removing some of or all of the reliefs a buerocratic task.

- Others, such individuals at the former mayor Lori Lightfood have said “It is easier to say, ‘this should go, that should go’ than make it happen.” Because the reliefs are part of the structure of the bridge their removal (without damaging the bridge) would be very difficult. Lightfoot's statement that “Just the mechanics of doing that are very, very complicated” rings true.

#### Arguments For Demolition
- The city commission argues that all four reliefs on the bridge (The Pioneers, Discoverers, The Defense, and Regemeration) “place the history of Chicago and the Battle of Fort Dearborn within an single narrative of the triumph of Western civilization. American Indians are used as merely a foil to help define the heroic acts and qualities of colonizing forces.”
