#### MONUMENT
The Regeneration Monument on Chicago's DuSable Bridge (formerly Michigan Avenue Bridge) commemorates the rebuilding of Chicago after the Great Fire of 1871, which devastated much of the city. The devastating fire leveled over 3 square miles of the city and left around 100,000 residents homeless. The fire, which occurred in October 1871, was a pivotal event in the city's history, ultimately leading to a massive reconstruction effort that transformed Chicago into a modern urban center and one of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S. The Regeneration Monument celebrates the city's resilience and progress in the face of destruction. The monument has faced controversy over time due to the way Indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups are depicted. Specifically, critics argue that the relief—while celebrating Chicago's industrial and economic progress—tends to marginalize or oversimplify the city's Native American history. 

The relief features a central female figure symbolizing the city, surrounded by figures of workers and builders engaged in rebuilding the city. While it celebrates the resilience and progress of Chicago, the monument overlooks the contributions of women, immigrants, African Americans, and Indigenous peoples in this pivotal period. Note the depiction of only male laborers of seeming Western European descent.

The DuSable Bridge was completed in 1920, connecting Chicago’s north and south sides along Michigan Avenue. While it is a feat of engineering achievement, its Birdgehouse sculptures celebrate early European explorers and the city’s rebuilding after the Great Fire. However, the underrepresentation of Indigenous people and DuSable, whose small monument contrasts with the grand Eurocentric sculptures, has sparked ongoing debates about historical inclusivity.

#### "REBEL ARCHIVE"
The map of downtown Chicago after the Great Fire of 1871 illustrates the city's rapid reconstruction, showcasing urban planning advancements and reflecting the remarkable transformation that occurred in the wake of devastation. This period was significant as it allowed for new architectural styles and infrastructure to support a burgeoning population, ultimately establishing Chicago as a major urban center and hub of economic growth. However, the map also highlights the controversy surrounding the rebuilding efforts, as it neglects to represent the contributions of women, immigrants, African Americans, and Indigenous peoples, who played essential roles in the recovery. Instead, the narrative often focuses on the achievements of white male entrepreneurs and architects, contributing to a historical account that overlooks the cultural contributions and histories of diverse communities. Additionally, the reconstruction frequently led to the displacement of poorer neighborhoods, particularly those inhabited by marginalized populations, prioritizing commercial development over housing. As a result, the map symbolizes not only the city's resilience and ambition but also the complexities and social inequities that emerged during this transformative period.

This map shows the many Indian trails and villages in the Chicago region, highlighting the locations of Native American settlements and trade routes that predate the city's establishment. Indigenous peoples, including the Potawatomi, Miami, and Illinois tribes, used these trails (marked in red) and waterways (in blue) for trade, travel, and communication. Many of the Native villages (green areas) were located along key rivers and lakes, making the region a significant crossroads for trade. When Chicago was built and rebuilt, much of the city's infrastructure, including major roads like Ogden and Archer Avenues, was developed directly over these ancient trails, while Native American villages and mounds were destroyed or forgotten. This map underscores how modern Chicago was constructed over a rich Indigenous history, much of which has been erased or overlooked as the city expanded.

#### COUNTER-MONUMENT

I wanted to create designs for the labor and/or Indigenous counter-monuments on the
DuSable Bridge that are meant to celebrate the diverse contributions to the city's history while
rejecting Eurocentric and colonialist narratives. Thus, the labor monument is meant to
emphasize collective effort and the contributions of marginalized groups such as women,
immigrants, African Americans, and Indigenous people to Chicago's industrial rise. It uses
symbolic shapes like hammers and gears to represent solidarity and peaceful social
movements. The Indigenous monument honors the deep-rooted history of Indigenous
civilizations in the Chicago region, highlighting their sophisticated societies and connection to
nature through abstract forms inspired by Native American patterns and symbols. Both
monuments aim to center marginalized voices and recognize long-overlooked contributions to
the city's development. 

The current Regeneration Monument portrays heroic European figures in a neoclassical style
which reinforces Eurocentrism and ignores the accomplishments of marginalized groups.
DALL.E was thus instructed to create a created-monument, designed to reject both
Eurocentrism and the neo-classical form. This abstract piece uses symbolic shapes and forms
to represent labor, peaceful protest, and inter-community collaboration. The absence of
traditional human figures shifts the focus away from individual heroes to emphasize collective
effort. Geometric and organic forms blend together, symbolizing unity, diversity, and the dynamic
connection between different communities. The industrial tools, such as hammers and shovels,
are abstractly represented to symbolize labor without reinforcing classical or colonial aesthetics.

both Eurocentrism and the neo-classical form while celebrating labor, collaboration, and
collective effort.” The ChatGPT(DALL.E)-generated image generated the above photo. ChatGPT 4.o 2024

While the Regeneration monument itself does not showcase colonial histories, it can
be seen as part of a greater Colonialist and Eurocentric narrative when combined with the three
other reliefs of the DuSable Bridge. DALL.E was thus instructed to create a counter monument
that honors the Indigenous civilizations, villages, and trails that once flourished on the lands that
would become Chicago. This design uses abstract shapes and patterns inspired by traditional
Native American symbols to represent the complexity and interconnectedness of Indigenous
societies, highlighting their strong ties to the land.The abstract shapes are meant to evoke the
movement of rivers, trails, and natural elements, symbolizing the extensive networks and trade
routes used by Indigenous peoples and the interconnectedness of the people’s who lived on the
land.

I found the use of AI to brainstorm and create counter monuments to be both an
innovative and challenging task. Chatgpt is able to rapidly explore concepts, adapt themes, and
create new responses based on feedback, creating a fluid dialogue. However, I found that I had
to be very specific with what I wanted when coming up with prompts as Chat GPT lacks the
cultural context and lived experience necessary for true authenticity, making it challenging to
generate symbols that can be used accurately and respectfully. AI’s reliance on existing data
means it often unintentionally reinforces biases and/or aesthetic choices that conflict with the
intended goals of challenging Eurocentric and colonial narratives. Thus it was at times difficult
working with the AI, having to go through several iterations of my prompts to get a result which
does not reinforce Eurocentric, and colonialist narratives. While I am impressed by the
ChatGPT’s ability to understand the prompts when given enough information and come up with
well thought out, in depth text responses, in its current state AI still needs critical human
guidance to ensure that its responses/designs are culturally sensitive and accurate.
