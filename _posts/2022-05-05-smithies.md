> Single-family homes act as the primary production of the spatialization of social hierarchies and systems of power. By mimicking their styles and applying an organized, often symmetrical composition of bungalows, the bungalow court formation reproduces this cultural geography while introducing a more acceptable version of affordable, multiunit housing. 
> 
> St. Francis Court is considered to be one of the first true bungalow courts. Sylvanus Marston designed the eleven bungalows and their orientation on the plot. The Pasadena court was fully constructed by 1909. Figure 1, the plot plan of St. Francis Court, highlights its thoughtful composition. The bungalows are organized in a U-shape with a central driveway, which bisects the communal space to create unmarked front gardens for each bungalow. At the curve of the U and the end of the driveway is the primary community amenity, "a fountain and seating area under a pergola" (Freestone & Nichols, 2012, p. 6). The composition is nearly symmetrical: the distance between and across bungalows are precise but each bungalow has slight differences in the floor plans. Being generally of similar sizes and prices, the design contributes to more demographically homogeneous occupants. The differences, however, support the ethos of the single-family bungalow. The bungalow court allows residents, even temporary ones, to embody the paired rugged individualism and simplicity of this domestic architectural style. Along the perimeter of the plot, there is a walkway "for deliveries and tradesmen’s access" (Freestone & Nichols, 2012, p. 6). The more communal aspects of St. Francis Court still does not invite a greater democratization of access to space or recognition. 
> 
> Future productions of the bungalow court moved away from St Francis Court’s spacious, luxurious expression of multifamily living. Bungalow courts popularity was largely driven by its socially-acceptable provision of higher-density, affordable rental housing. In order to maximize ground area, bungalow courts were frequently developed on deeper plots with narrower street frontage. Figure 2, a plot plan of an unnamed bungalow court in Los Angeles, California, is far more compact than Marston’s St. Francis Court. The composition still maintains the bilateral symmetry of previous bungalow court iterations and is roughly in a U-shape. The floor plans of each bungalow are more variable. This invites families of different sizes and different socioeconomic statuses into the communal environment. While there is less space for shared amenities, the plot plan still highlights the intended natural landscaping, marking the locations of grass and flower boxes. 
> 
> Bungalow courts made use of the popular single-family home architectural styles at a smaller scale. The historical postcard in Figure 3 is titled "Type of Bungalow Court Popular in Los Angeles, Calif. The Little Homes Have a Beautiful Community Front Yard." The image and the decisions made in its depiction emphasize the intentions behind the bungalow court. The perspective of the postcard makes it difficult to identify the bungalows as units of a multifamily development. Instead, the symmetry and vitality of the landscaping is one of the focal points of the illustration and the title. The postcard maintains the vibrant simplicity and order associated with bungalow court living. Such promotions of the bungalow court extended the site-level impacts of the courts’ designs.
