desc: "In line with Saint-Gaudens' typical sculpture work, the traditional bronze material and positioning are meant to celebrate the heroism exhibited by Logan in the various battles listed at the statue’s foundation. Moreover, Proctor’s expertise in life-size animal sculpting meant his equestrian statues work to represent military prowess all over the country. Together, these two artists worked to craft a monument memorializing a war hero of the Civil War."

#### MONUMENT
General John “Black Jack” Logan is most known for his Union Army successes in the Civil War and his commitment to championing Union war veterans. Throughout his life (1826-1886), Logan climbed the ranks of the Army and the American political system. Despite beginning his military career in the Mexican War, Logan first saw action in the Union Army and became a major general by 1863. Between and after militaristic endeavors, Logan was elected to the House of Representatives in 1858 and 1860 as a Democrat, and he was then elected to the House of Representatives and the Senate as a Republican from 1866 to 1886. In his political career, Logan was committed to honoring Union war veterans and has been credited as the founder of Memorial Day. In honor of his commitment to the country, the Illinois State legislature erected a monument in 1897 sculpted by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Alexander Phimister Proctor.

The scale, material, symbols, and context of the General John Logan Monument in Grant Park poignantly communicate the Northern glorification of the Civil War. As the monument sits on top of a hill, any viewer is placed physically underneath the general. Moreover, the immense size of the figure and the horse suggest the immense power and fame attributed to a war hero throughout America. The traditional bronze material pulls on the common heroic themes of war monuments and the listed battles at the foundation provide the additional context that this monument has the intended purpose of celebrating a general and the battles won. Ultimately, these symbols combine to communicate a purposeful glorification of the Civil War which in turn suggests themes of oppression and violence. 

This is a 1911 image of the monument. This image highlights the height and scale of the historical monument and emphasizes how little used to be surrounding the monument’s area.

#### "REBEL ARCHIVE"
As a stagnant monument, the General John Logan Monument fails to communicate a more nuanced history on the glorification of war. In celebrating war and Logan’s direct contributions to war, the monument cannot relay the propaganda, decimation, oppression, and violence of the Civil War. In the print of General Logan’s vice-presidential election bid, the connection between war contributions and political agenda is established. In this way, the glorification of war develops a means to an end as the ramifications for the victims was death and the consequences for the leaders was political gain. The war leaders, such as General Logan, evidently had a further motivation than just fighting for their beliefs – they also sought access to physical and political power. The narrative of the monument and the political propaganda challenges some aspects of the newspaper article depicting the immediate death General Logan saw when he was a Private at the Battle of Bull Run. Moreover, the political cartoon of General Logan and slave hunters challenges his war hero imagery. Despite having fought for the Union and allegedly against slavery, this rebel archives reveals a differing understanding of the purpose of Logan’s war efforts. By incorporating rebel archives, we are able to reach a more complex understanding of Logan’s work and war efforts and work against a sole, positive narrative for the military leader.

This image, from the General John A. Logan Museum, more overtly demonstrates the death and violence of war. Moreover, the cartoon displays a younger General Logan running into battle and being immediately faced with death. In comparison to the monument, this work illustrates the immense darkness and psychological, if not also physical, impacts of fighting in the Civil War.

This images relates the propaganda used for General John Logan’s Republican Vice Presidential bid in the 1884 election with James G. Blaine. The print relays pro-American images and figures, the catch phrase “Devotion to the Union,” and biographies of both candidates. By encapsulating the various propaganda techniques, we learn of how General Logan’s war contributions became the basis for his political agenda and accomplishments. Moreover, the document also provides to an understanding of why Logan switched political parties – from Democrat to Republican.

This cartoon tells of General John Logan political affiliation switches. Despite running for Vice President as Republican and fighting on behalf of the Union, this negative portrayal and nod to Logan’s affiliation with the Southerners suggests Logan’s war efforts were not as victorious as the monument suggests. The cartoon portrays General Logan as tolerating the brutal murder of enslaved peoples which opposes the victorious and positive messages of his success in the Civil War, allegedly fighting against slaveholders.

#### COUNTER-MONUMENT
Not only are war monuments controversial in their own right, but Logan’s career seemed ambivalent towards slavery and to posit him as the victor for the Union Army seems distasteful. Initially, he was a Democrat but Logan became a Republican (and fought for the union) for political gain. As he was not a genuine champion of abolition and contributed to the failure of reconstruction, I wanted the counter monument to reflect the reality of the Civil War through messages of death and violence. For the first counter-monument, I worked with Chat GPT to create a monument that would allow the audience to walk amidst the counter monument and be forced to reflect on how deadly the Civil War had been. When exploring symbols of death to challenge the glorification of war, Chat GPT developed the idea of empty boots to represent the deadly reality of war. This design was intended to allow an immersive experience in which audience members are faced with acknowledging lost souls and empty boots. For my second counter monument, I wanted to focus more on changing the original monument, rather than adding an element. As Logan had not expressed much concern about slavery during his political career, I wanted this counter monument to have General Logan with a remorseful and shameful expression that was paired with an acknowledgement to lives lost and unfulfilled promises. The wall behind Logan was created by Chat GPT and pulls on the power of the Vietnam Memorial. I also wanted this counter monument to emphasize the unfilled promises of the post-Civil War Reconstruction era as Logan’s political position would have contributed to this process. Ultimately, both of these monuments work to challenge the glorification war and remove Logan from an overwhelmingly positive and victorious position.

This image, created by Chat GPT, works to counter the war glorification of the first monument by adding a space specifically dedicated to reflecting on death. The empty boots with grassy walkways are intended to place audience members within the somber and reflective atmosphere. Additionally, plaque is added to commemorate the lives lost and to contextualize the meaning of the empty boots.

This image works to counter the pride and victorious themes of the original monument by reconfiguring the positioning of General John Logan and the backdrop. The head lowered position works to suggest that the Civil War was not as victorious as has been pushed to the collective conscious, and the list of walls works to commemorate lives lost and unfulfilled promises in the Civil War and post-Civil War era.

In creating the AI images for the counter-monument of General John Logan in Grant Part, Chat GPT 4.0 was very attached to keeping General John Logan mounted on his horse. Despite frequent attempts to have General John Logan equal with other aspects of the monument and incredibly specific requests, Chat GPT 4.0 kept Logan mounted. Additionally, Chat GPT 4.0 was determined to incorporate skulls in the counter monuments. When prompted to provide symbols countering the glorification of the Civil War, skulls and chains were the most frequent suggestions. Despite other symbols being selected for both counter monuments, Chat GPT 4.0 would place skulls at the base of the foundations. For the first counter monument the skulls were ultimately removed, but the Chat GPT 4.0 refused to remove the skulls. Evidently, Chat GPT 4.0 was incredibly interested in providing very specific models of a war hero and of death. The programs commitment to keeping General John Logan on his horse and incorporation skulls suggests that the collective conscious has specific expectations for symbolizing a war figure and symbolizing death.
