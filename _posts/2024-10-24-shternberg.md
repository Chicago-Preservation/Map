desc: “The column started its way as an actual structural support column of a building (not known exactly) on the shores of Ostia, one of Ancient Rome’s port cities. Around 2000 years later, in 1933, it was shipped off on a boat to the United States by Fascist Italy to commemorate the flight of Air Marshall Italo Balbo, who led a transatlantic flight in 1933. The base was also added at this time by Italian architects, made from Travertine, a popular stone used widely during the Roman Empire, containing an inscription and 4 bundles of fasces with axes on the sides.”

#### MONUMENT
>This monument can be interpreted as an ambitious Italy, wishing to cement itself as the new Roman Empire, quite literally ties itself to it by using the current regime as a base (the inscription, fasces) to elevate the long-nonexistent Roman Empire (the Corinthian column itself). Much like the Roman Empire did a lot of colonizing, Fascist Italy had many similar wishes (They tried to conquer a lot of the former Roman Empire and were mostly unsuccessful, especially in Greece. They were able to get some territories like Algeria but had to also resort to colonizing territories never part of the Roman Empire like Ethiopia. In Ethiopia the Italians did some brutal things. There is an idea that Italy during WWII was better than Germany in terms of human rights and while that was true in some regards (for example, they wouldn’t give up their Jews), it was still an incredibly problematic regime.) This column and the symbols on it serve to glorify that regime and the colonialism that it perpetrated. It uses the Corinthian column as something that to Americans signifies a very different thing, as in the American classical architecture tradition the column harkened back to the Greek democracies and Roman Republic, not the Roman Empire. However, the fascist symbolism is almost ‘slipped’ under it, hoping almost to pass as something normal within a US city, by using a top-symbol which is already established. This monument, being laid in 1933, could be the marks of secret aspirations that the US will become like Fascist Italy, and transfer into wanting to be an Empire (like it had tried to be only 30-40 years prior with the Spanish-American war). That war was the closest America had gotten to being a traditional empire, but the pushback to it was 40 years of near-strict isolationism (with the exception of WWI). While debates would rage about which groups the American republic should and shouldn’t serve, there would not be any debates about whether the US should become an empire, like Rome had. This may be speculation, but the goodwill gesture of the gift itself could have also been a start of the Axis powers convincing the United States to join their side, and there were certainly prominent figures in 1930s America who would have been on-board with that alliance such as Charles Lindbergh (who, like Balbo, was coincidentally also a transatlantic pilot) 
> 
It is important to, when considering the Balbo monument, also consider what kind of man Balbo was. Putting aside his ties at the time of the transatlantic flight to fascism, what did he go on to do (or not do)? Surprisingly, he was put in the governorship of Libya position not because of his loyalties to Mussolini - but as a form of banishment. Even though he was well-respected within the fascist government of Italy, he was not in favor of the Italian-Nazi alliance and for this he was ‘cast out’. While in Libya, he was in favor of repopulating Italians to the new colony as the Roman empire had done in the past. The problematic part of this mostly resides in the fact that to have the space for the Italian colonists to come in, the previous governor and leadership committed mass atrocities against the Libyan population. Whether Balbo was in favor of those policies is unknown, but it is worth noting that Balbo was also against the German race laws and policies against Jews (there is a story that when prominent Nazi officials came to visit, at a state dinner, he invited Italian Jews to be his guests of honor). Balbo essentially stood up to Mussolini at a time when that was not popular to do in Italy. There is a common narrative that all things fascist and nazi are the same and interchangeable, but Balbo’s story shows that this is not so. There is more to Balbo than what meets the eye, and when protesting the Balbo monument, we have to ask ourselves: do we hate the monument because it is to Balbo, or because it is to fascism? It is perfectly reasonable to say ‘both’, but to state that Balbo was only a cog in the fascist machine is not doing justice to the complicated legacy Balbo left behind.

Not the actual creation photo of the monument, but of the moment it became important: a gift of Italy to the United States at the World’s Fair. However, it is that of a new Italy, one that believes it is the direct inheritor of the Roman Empire in the modern-day. That of course is a fascist Italy. The banner in the background is the flag of Monarchist Italy, with the coat of arms in the middle the family crest of the House of Savoy, whose second to last king invited Benito Mussolini to form a government in 1922. This would become the flag the Italians used to fight in WWII under, with the Axis powers. The Italian pavilion itself is shaped to resemble a plane, a more literal but fleeting commemoration of Italo Balbo’s flight, while the column was the physical ‘embodiment’ of it. The column is placed very prominently in front of the Italian pavilion, marking its undeniable connection to the state of Fascist Italy.

A meek little thing compared to the skyline above it, unless you know that it was the Italo Balbo monument, it is very easy to glance over. The commemorative plaque in English and Italian long since having faded, and the axes having been taken off the fasces on the pedestal, most people would not think of it as a symbol of anything, much less the racism and colonialism of 1930s-40s Italy. Without a symbol marking what it truly is, it stands as a forgotten reminder of times past, almost hoping that people don’t notice it - or remember why it is there. The Corinthian column becomes just one of hundreds which hold up various vast pedestals, buildings, and memorials across the city of Chicago.

This is an image of Mussolini meeting with Balbo in Libya. The Libya part I will discuss for the next picture, but this is important to see because the monument honoring this man can be seen as a vassal for honoring Mussolini. A picture like this helps people on the fence of the Balbo monument question the real purpose of the column and its ties to despotic people.

This is now Governor Balbo. He was given the governorship of Libya due to his political influence and power within the fascist government. While he was not the one who committed the Libyan genocide outright (that was before he became governor) he inherited a power structure that was put in place using that genocide to exist (i.e, the slaughter of the Libyans made it possible for the Italians to rule Libya firmly in the first place).

#### COUNTER-MONUMENT

In the center is the Balbo column (apparently, GPT has forgotten that it has a Corinthian, not Ionic, capital, but it did its best) and this time the counter-monument is more about the visitor experience. It adds not just one ring of information around the monument, but also includes interactive stands, each of which could serve to create an interactive experience and also be updated when necessary to serve many generations of the public. Then, there is still a ‘counter-monument’ aspect, which are the steel columns going right around the monument, which can visually symbolize the uglier ‘other histories’ that the column is tied to such as fascism and Mussolini.

In the middle is the Balbo column, but around it are two circles: one standing, and one around it. The standing one serves as a literal ‘counter’ to the monument, changing it visually to visually note its problematic identity. Then, the circle around it serves as information for visitors seeing the column to find out for themselves what the actual history is.

My original idea was to re-incorporate the Balbo monument column into a triumphal arch of WW2, essentially turning a monument against its intended meaning. While I do think a triumphal arch over WW2 would be a really interesting idea, I don’t think it should incorporate the Balbo column. Incorporating the column would mean watering down its history into a larger project; making it less visible in a concert of other columns and decorative motifs. Instead, the best way to create a counter-monument would be to allow the public to find out the real history of the monument and what ties it has. This would be achieved through informational plaques or displays. I also wanted to keep the monument intact, as there is a compelling argument coming from the Italian community about wanting to celebrate the positive aspects of it. Thus, the counter-monument should also include a series of panels about the triumphs of the Italian-American community, to celebrate their successes as well as being able to see the pitfalls of using a problematic monument to do so (which would be the rest of the information on the panels). Plus, the column is the oldest ‘thing’ in Chicago, and this fact alone attracts many visitors to the monument (that is why I, for example, visited it last year), so to get rid of it would mean less foot traffic and thus less visibility of the history. Lastly, incorporating a visual ‘counter-weight’ to the monument itself would show a more artistic approach to the recontextualizing that the plaques would do with text and images. This would be good for people who cannot read very well, thus incorporating even more of the public, as well as adding an artistic touch which is good to have since people generally like looking at beautiful or interesting monuments and so would bring in even more people. The Balbo monument is not noticed by many, it is a small and often overlooked part of Chicago and Chicago history, and so to make it into a public history destination would mean more people learn about it.
