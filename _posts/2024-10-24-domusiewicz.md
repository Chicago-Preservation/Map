#### MONUMENT
The Robert Cavalier de La Salle Monument is a bronze statue commissioned by Lambert Tree in 1889. It is located in Chicago’s Lincoln Park, on the corner of two busy streets, West La Salle Drive and Clark Street. Robert Cavalier de La Salle was a French explorer and fur trader who arrived in Quebec, Canada in 1666. He is most known for exploring the Great Lakes area and claiming the basin of the Mississippi for France and renaming the area to Louisiana after the French king. La Salle is quite literally placed on a very tall pedestal (almost as tall as the statue itself), he is carved wearing a fur trimmed jacket, the coat and boots are very typical of a white explorer at the time. The artist included both a pistol and a sword on the statue. Weaponry holds the connotation of destruction, and that La Salle was in North America for capital gain without caring for the wildlife that was already present. Count Jacques gave La Salle a stoic expression; his impassive features create the feeling of menacing grandeur. The last aspect I noticed was his foot resting atop a log or rock. Paired with La Salle’s hand on his hip this gives the impression of conquest and ownership, as if the land La Salle “discovered” belonged to him and by extension, France. The statue being made out of bronze connotes his importance, that he was integral enough to the formation of history that his memory deserves to be cast in a semi-precious, long-lasting metal.

In this image of the Robert Cavalier de La Salle monument, the prominence of the spot it is displayed in is evident. Placed at the intersection of two busy streets makes this monument a view that many Chicagoans see on their daily commutes, drilling colonial imagery into the minds of the Chicago public. La Salle’s pose with his foot propped up and eyes towards the horizon mirror his colonization efforts, to use the indigenous tribes to his advantage, and then eradicate them for French gain.

#### "REBEL ARCHIVE"
Robert Cavalier de La Salle was aided in his exploration by multiple indigenous tribes, like the Seneca Tribe, who are native to the area surrounding Niagara Falls. La Salle was exploring. This monument is actively silencing indigenous voices, not acknowledging the fact that La Salle would not have been successful in his journey had it not been for native tribes assisting him. La Salle’s monument perpetuates ideas of coloniality, his goal as was to create a French monopoly in furs, disregarding the natives’ views on proper use of animals, and taking the resources of their land. By building forts and claiming native land in the name of France he is complicit in the mass displacement of Native Americans.

A painting by Jean-Adolphe Bocquin titled Taking possession of Louisiana and the River Mississippi, in the name of Louis XIVth. La Salle is reading a doctrine claiming the land in the name of the French king with an erected monument as a physical symbol of his colonialism. Native Americans are pictured in the background going about their daily tasks, appearing to be unbothered by the presence of the Frenchmen. The natives at the forefront of the piece are depicted with leaves in their hair and holding a large spear, contributing to the stereotypical white views of Natives. On the left of the painting there is a woman hugging her child with another one next to her. This gives the impression that the Frenchmen are “saving” her, when in reality she appears to be cowering away from the Frenchmen. La Salle’s sword is being used to point at the ground, in this depiction it is no longer a combat weapon, but rather one used for claiming and taking land.

This 1902 Lithography of the French explorer cements his place in the public eye as an explorer worth commemorating. The elaborate detailing surrounding the bust-length portrait is a call upon classic noble iconography. The knight in the center just underneath La Salle looks to be a sort of coat of arms, a traditional symbol of royal status. Overall, this piece oozes La Salle’s importance, it being made several hundred years after his death only shows how ingrained his legacy is in the public mind. Elaborate dedications to French colonialism is all you can find on La Salle, interestingly there is little art reflecting the ways his colonization negatively impacted the Native Americans he exploited.

#### COUNTER-MONUMENT

The original concept for the first counter-monument is to overrun the original Robert Cavalier de La Salle monument with plant life native to the Illinois region. This includes plants like butterfly milkweed, black cohosh, marsh bell flower, and purple coneflower. By taking the statue of La Salle down and overrunning the pedestal with native plants it acts as taking back the land that La Salle colonized. These plants represent the native land and the prospering Indigenous life before French colonizers forcibly took over. This counter-monument provides a greener, more welcome view to Lincoln Park visitors and passersby, rather than the current beige concrete surrounding the pedestal and park entrance. The goal would be to get rid of as much of the neutral concreteness of the surrounding area and replace it with plant life. Getting rid of the urban city parts has the goal of making viewers examine the sacrifices of Native American land and culture for the urbanization and colonization of white landscape and life.

Image generated using ChatGPT from the prompt create an image of the Robert Cavalier de La Salle monument in Chicago but with the actual statue of La Salle on the ground and nowhere else on the pedestal. The pedestal should be surrounded and overgrown with plants that are native to Illinois, like the marsh bell flower, butterfly milkweed, black cohosh, and purple coneflower.

The concept of the second counter-monument came from the artistic designs of both past and contemporary indigenous artists. This sidewalk mural is intended to replace the current Robert Cavalier de la Salle monument located on the edge of Lincoln Park. The goal is to get rid of as much of the beige concrete as possible and create a space for Native art to be showcased to the many commuters that pass through the intersection where the current monument stands. The mural took inspiration from the work of contemporary indigenous artists such as Ahmoo Angeconeb, Joshim Kekgamic and Carl Beam. Ideally this mural would be a collaboration between multiple indigenous artists painting symbols important to their own cultures and traditions. Surrounding the mural would be the same native Illinois plants that would be planted in counter-monument 1. This counter-monument is erasing the acknowledgement of La Salle completely, and instead is shining a spotlight onto the indigenous voices that were present before French colonization.

Using ChatGPT to generate images of counter-monuments was a process that divulged the views of the common mind. When asked to create a counter-monument with the statue of La Salle off the pedestal, ChatGPT only created images with La Salle on the pedestal. After several prompts, the AI finally placed La Salle on the ground. However, it placed him in a lifeless, helpless position. It is interesting how when given the simple prompt, “place La Salle on the ground” it chose to depict him as if he were killed. Interestingly, when asked to place a member of the Algonquin tribe on the pedestal, the statue of Robert La Salle on the ground changed to a statue of a deer. Based on this exercise it can be inferred that the collective consciousness deems La Salle of enough importance that if he was not on the pedestal, it meant that he is helpless and placed lower as an act of ill will only. On the other hand, when placing an Indigenous person on the pedestal, the collective consciousness places animals and other natural imagery that was irrelevant to the prompt. There is clearly still bias about Indigenous people and what they represent. Creating the mural of indigenous art was easier, but ChatGPT still utilized stereotypical Native American imagery until prompted to base its creation on contemporary Indigenous artists that were provided as an example. This is a commentary on how the collective consciousness still associates Native Americans with the symbols presented by media rather than the actual imagery used by native communities.
