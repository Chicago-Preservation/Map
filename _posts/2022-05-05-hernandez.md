>Beverly Hills has always been a unique site. The first original inhabitants were the native Tongva, which recognized the land as a kind of oasis in a semi-arid basin and called it "The Gathering of the Waters." They discovered it as well as the famous Spanish explorer Don Jose Gaspar de Portola and when his expedition happened upon Tongova's Eden, but he also translated the land to "El Rodeo de las Aguas." Later on, Tongva got wiped out by smallpox. In 1838, the governor of the Mexican controlled the California territory, which was about 4,500 acres that constituted the core of present day Beverly Hills, to Maria Rita Valdez Villa, the African Mexican widow of a Spanish soldier. Due to certain circumstances, the land was sold to various people until the 1880s, when Henkel Hammel and Charles Denker acquired it. Their purpose was to create Morocco, a subdivision with a North African theme, but it wasn't possible since the US economic collapse in 1888, which ended the plans. In 1900 Burton E . Green bought the land to produce oil for his company, but they weren't able to, and they ended up producing a lot of water, enough to support the town. All this led Green and his partners in 1906 to rename their company the "Rodeo Land and Water Company," which was inspired by Beverly Farms, Massachusetts; Green and his wife renamed the bean field Beverly Hills.

> Wilbur David Cook was a famous American landscape planner from Atlanta. In 1907 he was hired to design a street plan for Beverly Hills. He designed curving streets with large lots on the north side and small lots on the south side, and a triangular commercial district. All roads were tree-lined, and the land was set aside for high schools, four elementary schools, and public parks. The plan was to make the area affordable to a range of incomes as long as buyers weren't Jewish or Black. Around the 1940s, that restriction fell off thanks to a lawsuit brought by Hattie Mcdaniel and other notable African Americans. However, I believe the restriction has hugely influenced Beverly to be a predominantly white community since it portrays the aspect of race Beverly Hills wanted to be since the beginning . The first house was created in 1907, but potential buyers were interested in 1912. 
> 
> The extravagant establishment Beverly Hotels was created on May 12 , 1912 served not only for people who travel but also a city hall, movie theater, community center, and religious worship venue. Beverly Hills Hotel came into existence as a promotional strategy by the Rodeo Land and Water Company to encourage land sales; the Mission Revival style building and lush landscape were created to attract prospective buyers through the myth of living in California. Due to the great depression in the 1940s, it was closed for a short period of time until 1941, when some investors purchased the hotel and hired Paul R . Willaims and interior designers John Luccareni and Paul Laszlo to redesign and update the lobby. The designers decided to cover the lobby walls with distinctive banana leaf wallpaper to give the hotel its chic pink, white and green colors. Courtright and associates announce the new, refreshed look as the melding of Southern California and LA design styles as flowering, spacious, sunny palm-shaded best. At the turn of the century, people were very much influenced by the European model, and they were bringing things over here and experimenting to see what would work. The more electric the area was, the more prestigious the property was perceived to be. The Beverly Hills Hotel had a tremendous amount of plant material which made it unique and different.

> Homes in Beverly Hills are distinct and usually varied based on the appearance and style of vases in their owners. Beverly Hills home architecture ranges from popular period revival pieces to modern masterpieces: the five most famous styles seen and created  are Spanish colonial, Rural European, Contemporary, Traditional, and Period Revival. Spanish Colonial Revival was famous between 1915 and 1931, and Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow were the leaders who exposed that model. The house features a stucco exterior and white paint contrasted against painted tiles. The color of the places was typically ornamental work that did not compete with the simple elegance of the style. In this architectural design, courtyards, balconies, and patios are important in encouraging the enjoyment of outdoor spaces. The rural European style features a traditional floor plan, including a large backyard and pool, representing the outdoor area. Rural European usually includes archetypal styles of French Normandy and English Cottage. They have arched windows of different sizes, doorways, decorative fascia boards, window boxes, and a curvilinear route leading to the entranceway. Contemporary homes usually include postmodern, modern, and international-style houses. Its emphasis is on entertaining and incorporating nature and the outdoors. Home tends to be more casual and has an open floor plan with irregularly shaped frames. As we could see Beverly Hills housing architecture tends to be fancy and luxurious to attract the most wealthy. 
>
> Since the beginning, the designation & planning for Beverly Hills has always been for the wealthy to attract the wealthy community which shows segregation. Things I provided show how they tried to be different with their architectural style to call attention. During the development of Beverly Hills, the wealthy were the white community, so they wanted to attract them to be a predominantly white community, influencing why Beverly Hills is primarily white.
