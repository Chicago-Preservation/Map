In the 1920’s, when Hollyhock House was constructed, society viewed women as feminine and romantic objects rather than rational agents.1  Wright internalized this notion, accordingly designing Hollyhock in a “California Romanza” style that prioritized aesthetic interaction with the natural environment.2 This romantic, idealistic style undermined Barndsall’s vision of a tangible, purposeful community that would challenge societal norms by expanding the definition of the home from solely a private sphere.3 The resulting architecture appeared most definitively in the living room, specifically, in the design of a focal fireplace and its corresponding mantle artwork.

The design for the fireplace stemmed from pervasive gender stereotypes that labeled women as naturally desirous of a steady lifestyle. At one point in his biography, Wright attributed Barnsdall’s motivations for building Hollyhock House to her want for a “beautiful” home that lent “stability and focus” to her erratic life.4 As such, he crafted a fireplace that exuded equilibrium, peace, and grace in its flowing, natural design. Above the fireplace, a skylight provided rhythm with its cycle of night and day; the pool’s constant stream of water symbolized stability in a California environment prone to droughts. The hearth of fire, placed in between the light and water, brought together the trifecta.5 Instead of promoting personal agency, the fireplace attempted to provide Barnsdall with the literal and figurative domestic warmth that she was perceived to lack.

	Additionally, in line with the “separate spheres” logic of the twentieth century, Wright designed the mantlepiece to symbolize a “woman’s special domain.”6 The shapes repeated across the rectangular stone echoes the recurring, naturalistic style of the fireplace that it is situated on. A geometric figure reigns in the top left corner, appearing to “rule over a vast landscape.”7 According to Wright’s son, Barnsdall was this figure, “an Indian princess seated upon her throne”8. Although the mantlepiece appears to be a spectacle of female power, it actually reinforces domestic norms. In her commission, Barnsdall did not intend to create a “queendom” or “principality” for herself. In fact, she intended quite the opposite: to facilitate a public arena of feminine discourse free from the societal conventions of the Midwest and Northeast.9 By making her out to naturally be a feminine princess of her own home, Wright pigeonholes female power into solely the domestic realm.

The overall style of the living room, described by Wright as a “holiday adventure in Romanza”, connotated a pleasurable showcase of femininity.10 In his attempts to domesticate Barnsdall, he described her “as domestic as a shooting star”, further delegitimizing her ambition as only a ‘pretty’, fleeting wish.11 Overall, Wright’s stylistic focus on a romanticized and ultimately, conforming, aesthetic undermines Barnsdall’s original vision that transcended society’s ‘natural’ order.

Mantlepiece sketch by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The draft design is abstract, geometric, and asymmetric, yet the combined shapes on the far left still reference natural elements such as the Hollyhock flower. This artwork serves as a metaphor for the house atop the hill. The small figure sitting on the lower circle is conjectured to be Aline Barnsdall, reigning as queen over her dominion. The viewer is drawn to survey the art from left to right – east to west – representing the direction of the sun rising.

Archival photograph of the same fireplace mantlepiece, see first image. This clearer image shows the final stone work. Changes from drafting to carving can be seen in the top banner: the final product shows continuous, vertical marks that signal movement and consistency. The figure sitting atop the lower circle contains much more detail; for example, the left-most rectangle appears to be rising out of the wall, its depth adding to the illusion of a literal and figurative pedestal.
