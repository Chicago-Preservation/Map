The Drake Fountain, also known as the Columbus Monument, was built in 1892 by Richard Henry Park and is located at 92nd Street and South Chicago and Exchange Avenues. This monument was a gift from John B. Drake, the owner of the Chicago hotel, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's voyage to America. Originally, the fountain stood on Washington Street in front of the old City Hall-County building. However, in 1909, after the threat of demolition, it was moved to its current location due to a social movement defending the monument’s survival, which involved groups like the Knights of Columbus fraternal organization. This relocation also followed the South Chicago community's request for more public art in the area. In 2004, the fountain was officially designated a Chicago landmark, despite its complex history. The story took another turn in 2020 when the Columbus statue was removed as a protective measure during social movements in Chicago protesting problematic monuments.

The Drake Fountain was designed in the Gothic Revival style by Richard Henry Park to emphasize Chicago's growing alignment with European traditions and grandeur. Composed of granite, the monument features a square column with a pyramidal cap atop a quatrefoil base, from which flying buttresses extend at each corner. The granite base, a material associated with strength and durability, reinforces the monument’s role as a lasting tribute to Columbus and the so-called “discovery,” symbolizing the enduring power of colonial history. Originally functional, the large circular basins at the base once provided drinking water but now serve purely as decoration. Above the now-absent statue of Columbus, a bronze plaque reads, "Ice water fountain gift of John B. Drake to the city of Chicago 1892." Though the statue itself is missing, the granite base remains, inscribed with "Christopher Columbus," though much of the inscription has become illegible due to neglect. Historical records suggest that the monument once depicted a young Columbus, symbolizing his role as a student of geography, holding a globe in one hand and a compass in the other. Despite the statue’s absence, the materials used in the monument continue to convey a sense of endurance and timelessness. Bronze and granite, frequently used in commemorative sculptures, evoke permanence and grandeur, reinforcing the importance of the figures they represent. This material choice reflects the colonial narrative, framing Columbus as a heroic figure and the “discovery of the Americas” as the only timeless narrative worth commemorating. The current location of the fountain on the far South Side of Chicago, within a predominantly Black and Latinx community, raises complex questions about its relevance. While its relocation was initially a response to community calls for more public art, it also highlights the systemic neglect and marginalization of the area. Instead of representing the community, the monument underscores the power dynamics of segregation and the colonial legacy of conquest, where white supremacy and Eurocentrism are emphasized. The monument stands as a testament to a problematic history, commemorating the erasure of Native communities and glorifying colonization as a civilizing mission. It also overlooks other communities of color, particularly those that have been deeply affected by this ideology. In its current state, the monument symbolizes the ongoing marginalization of Black, Latinx, and Native American narratives in history—voices that are often silenced in favour of a misleading representation that strips them of agency, even in their own neighbourhoods.

Chicago, 1906, Pedestrians pass by the Drake Fountain on LaSalle Street, seen here in its original location on Washington Street in front of the old City Hall-County Building, was constructed in 1892 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s voyage. The monument was a gift from John B. Drake, but in 1909, it was relocated to the South Chicago area after efforts to save it from demolition. The fountain has since witnessed both appreciation as a piece of public art and controversy, particularly with the removal of the Columbus statue in 2020 amid protests problematic historical figures.

The Drake Fountain, designed in the Gothic Revival style by Richard Henry Park, was originally meant to celebrate Columbus and align Chicago with European grandeur. Now situated on Chicago’s far South Side, within a predominantly Black and Latinx community, the monument raises complex questions about its relevance and historical legacy. Once a functional fountain, it now serves as a symbol of colonial power and segregation, standing in contrast to the marginalized voices of Native, Black, and Latinx communities whose histories have been overlooked.

#### "REBEL ARCHIVE"
Me-Te-A was a prominent Potawatomi chief, known for his leadership and resistance against U.S. expansion during the early 19th century. His portrait, ME-TE-A: A Pottawatomie Chief, belongs to the collection History of the Indian Tribes of North America, published by Thomas L. McKenney and James Hall between 1836 and 1844. This collection features biographies and illustrations of Native American leaders. Me-Te-A played a crucial role in defending Potawatomi lands in the Midwest, particularly in what is now Illinois and Indiana. He was known for his eloquent speeches and resistance to ceding land to the U.S. government. The Native American Trails and Villages map, created by Albert F. Scharf in the late 19th century, further challenges the colonial narrative. It depicts a vast network of Indigenous trails in the Chicago area that mirror today’s interstate highways, illustrating how Native peoples used the land long before European settlers arrived. The extensive network of trails used by tribes such as the Potawatomi and Miami was later adapted into modern roadways, including major highways that remain today. In contrast to the narrative represented in the Drake Fountain, which glorifies European colonization, Native American communities thrived long before the arrival of Columbus. These communities were not "discovered," but rather conquered through genocidal expeditions, during which approximately 95% of the population perished, and the survivors were forced to assimilate to new languages, religions, and cultures to endure. Despite centuries of violence and erasure by European settlers, Indigenous communities have resisted and survived, becoming the invisible heroes of history and the true architects of the land upon which the European "civilization" was built. Although history has often tried to overshadow figures like Me-Te-A with the glorification of Columbus, Me-Te-A’s legacy as a defender of his people's lands stands as a symbol of resistance against colonization and forced displacement. Both Me-Te-A's legacy and the map serve as vital reminders of the deep connection between Indigenous communities and the land, as well as the enduring influence Native American infrastructure has had on contemporary urban development. Together, they highlight the resilience of Native peoples and their central role in the history and shaping of the region.

Me-Te-A, a prominent Potawatomi chief, is known for his leadership and resistance against U.S. expansion in the early 19th century. This portrait, part of the History of the Indian Tribes of North America collection (1836-1844), reflects his role in defending Potawatomi lands in the Midwest, particularly in Illinois and Indiana. Me-Te-A’s legacy as a powerful orator and protector of his people's territory stands as a symbol of resistance against colonization and forced displacement.

This map, created by Albert F. Scharf in the late 19th century, shows the extensive network of Native American trails and villages in the Chicago area before European colonization. These trails, used by tribes such as the Potawatomi and Miami, were later adapted into modern roadways, illustrating how Indigenous communities shaped the region’s landscape. The map challenges colonial narratives, emphasizing that Indigenous people thrived on this land long before European settlers arrived.
