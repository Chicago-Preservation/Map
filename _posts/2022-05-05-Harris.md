>Echo Park’s design is rooted in several modernizing renovations that have sought to make it more appealing to park-goers, catering to the interests of the gentrifying class moving in while excluding undesirable unhoused populations using it for domestic place-making. The renovation of Echo Park Lake’s boathouse to stay updated with the trends of the 1930s and the wants of many of its residents demonstrates how design updates and improvements push towards a modern gentrified ideal in a so-called bad neighborhood. The surrounding area was considered 'definitely blighted' with "some sections which are still in the declining period" because of the prevalence of marginalized and lower income groups (Nelson). Furthermore, the design was considered outdated by the 1920s-30s, and dissatisfied park residents made "calls to replace the Victorian-style boathouse" with one to match the "new wave of development...with Spanish-style cottages and apartments coming into vogue" (Echo Park Lake, 2005). This construction was done in 1932, and the park had to be closed for the duration of it (Echo Park Lake Refilled, 1932: 18). The photograph Boathouse at Echo Park shows the wavy tile roof that is a hallmark of this style, and stands as a place of transition from one colonial design style to the next, all to the tastes of the middle and upper classes. With physical changes being made to the layout of the park came the erasure of its local community.

> Today, Echo Park renovations directly result in the active removal of unhoused people from the park, continuing the historical legacy of modifying the park to the tastes of wealthy White people at the expense of the already poor and marginalized. This is all through a process of gentrification, which "is not just about changing the present; intentionally or not, it erases the past" (Molina: 2015, 100). Such an emphasis on improvement and modernization not only forces spaces like Echo Park to be in constant cycles of renovation in order to keep up with aesthetic demand, but also displaces and dispossesses those not included in this vision of how the space is meant to be used. In 2020, the city of Los Angeles decided that "Echo Park was once again in a state of disrepair" and needed to be closed and renovated (Echo Park Rehabilitation, 2020: 7). However, these renovations included getting rid of its sizable homeless population. Their process of removal, with little care paid to peoples' lives after being forced from their park camp, was more about removing unhoused people from public space than actually finding them housing. Campers "had a community kitchen and garden, a job program, and showers" with "a community and people who looked after each other," as one former resident reflected (Levin 2022). The design of the Echo Park encampment may not have fit the societal aesthetic ideals, but it did allow for the place-making of domesticity, bringing some comfort and stability to many in precarious situations. This was not how those policing this space wanted it to be used, which is why they wanted them gone and the park to be remade.
