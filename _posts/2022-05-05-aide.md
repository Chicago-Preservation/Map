 >The hospital, designed by Yos Hirose, was fashioned in a Streamline Moderne style that was a subtype of Artdeco. Manifested through the architecture and space of the hospital is the constructed idea of modernity, efficiency, and being a cultural agency that contributes to the well-being of the community.

The Streamline Moderne style emerged in the 1930s. This style of architecture “is essentially a machine aesthetic focused on mass production, functional efficiency”(Hernández-Navarro, 2016: 9), and aerodynamic design. This style of architecture gave the hospital an impression of modernity and state-of-the-art facilities. Figure 1 is a photograph taken in 1929, the hospital's opening year, and it shows the hospital’s original simple smooth stucco exterior cladding and flat roof. The minimal ornamentation, in addition to the clean lines and smooth curves of its architectural design, characterizes efficiency and a sense of motion. The sense of mobility in the Streamline Moderne style embodies the hospital’s cultural agency, as it is significant in representing this particular hospital due to the attempts made by exclusive legislation to prevent the establishment’s success. The way that the architectural design illustrates modernity also represents a shift towards progress and a better life, which the hospital does by giving racial and ethnic minorities in the area a chance at better healthcare.

The “modest exterior of the building, highly sensitive to the economic climate of the time, also suggested that a significant portion of the money designated for the construction of the hospital was spent on the interior spaces” (Hayashi, 2016: 28). The interior had 69 rooms. According to Hayashi, the original architectural plans include a basement with “a dining room, kitchen, laundry room, and storeroom. The first floor contained exam rooms, a drug dispensary, nurses' dressing room, X-ray lab, chart room, lab, linen room, parlor, library, and waiting room. A major operating room, minor operating room, delivery room, X-ray room, nursing room, children's room, doctors' dressing room, and wash-up room were located on the second floor” (Hayashi, 2016: 28). Figure 2 shows the geometric shape of the hospital in comparison to the other neighboring buildings. The rectangular shape, which is consistent with characteristics of long horizontal lines in the Streamline Moderne style, followed by the fact that the hospital had only two stories, suggested that everything was organized in close vicinity to one another. This interior organization would increase the efficiency of the hospital with the intention of serving as many people as possible, which was one of the hospital’s most important goals in response to the influx of Japanese immigrants that came in the early 1920s. Figure 1 also includes a smaller image of one of the hospital's medical rooms. It is easy to recognize that the room looks spacious, which allows for mobility and fast-paced work. The windows along the walls are large, allowing for a great amount of natural light within the room. This shows that visibility was taken into consideration in the architectural design as well as allowing their patients to experience sunlight. These combined elements show how the design of the hospital contributed to creating an efficient and safe working environment with the goal of providing accessible service and healthcare to all members of the community.
