> Sullivan Canyon was constructed with the wealthy elite in mind. The physical design and appearance of Sullivan Canyon perpetuates the exclusionary, and racist and economically unequal ideals present behind the initial concept of the neighborhood itself.

> This drawing(Sullivan Drawing) shows the basic outline of Sullivan Canyon. May’s vision seemed to be an isolated utopia, nestled in the hills. Each house is isolated from the others as well, each structure being placed on its own decently sized tract of land. The neighborhood is also surrounded by trails and is largely inaccessible from the outside.
> 
> This picture(Sullivan Exterior) depicts the exterior of one of the homes in Sullivan Canyon. Here, the isolation of the neighborhood, and the home within the neighborhood itself is evident. Surrounded by shrubbery, isolated in the hills, this home is not accessible to many. Sullivan Canyon, purposefully designed to be isolated, contributes to economic segregation. The background shows how isolated the neighborhood is from the back, and the front shows the masterful landscaping that establishes each home as its own distinct property. Sullivan Canyon is physically distanced from other neighborhoods of lower economic status. It contributes to the “concentration of families with abundant resources in economically homogenous neighborhoods''(Bischoff & Reardon, 2014).  The families that can afford to purchase a home in Sullivan Canyon have a high influx of income, and the isolation helps to protect their investments. “These patterns concentrate wealth, human and social capital, and political influence in places far from the poor, and increasingly far from the middle class as well. …  any self-interested investment the rich make in their own communities has little chance of “spilling over” to benefit middle- and low-income families”(Bischoff & Reardon, 2014) The physical isolation of the neighborhood, evident in this image(Sullivan Exterior), ensures that the mass amounts of income are circulated within the higher social class, and that it does not trickle down to help those economically disadvantaged.

> This image(Sullivan Trail) shows the ranch aesthetic that Cliff May envisioned. The wooden fences, and somewhat rough, ranch-like dirt road are depicted here. There is also a lack of sidewalks, which decreases accessibility to those without cars. This neighborhood is intentionally not made walkable, as it was meant for people to ride horses on the trails, or be accessible by car. Those are luxuries which during that time period, the elite notably had access to. “the absence of sidewalks … and other design elements can shape the demographics of a city and isolate a neighborhood from those surrounding it. In this way, the exclusionary built environment—the architecture of a place—functions as a form of regulation”(Schindler, 2015). The design of the trails, and lack of sidewalks further help isolate this neighborhood and keep it economically segregated.
