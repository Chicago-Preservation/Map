#### MONUMENT
Ivan Mestrovic was a Croatian sculptor, although he trained throughout Europe, including in Vienna, Paris, and Kosovo. He worked in the early 20th century, and was in Chicago in 1925. While his stay was due to an Art Institute exhibition, he would leave commissioned by the B.F. Ferguson Fund. His job was to create two statues, which he would begin to work on in 1926. The final statues would be completed in 1928, and these would be the Bowman and the Spearman. The Bowman and the Spearman sit on South Michigan Avenue, in Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois. While they are close to Ida B. Wells Drive, which is named after one of the founders of the NAACP, as well as a prominent activist in her own right, the drive was named in 2018, after the monuments were already in place. This, in addition to the fact that Wells’ activism focused on the plight of the Black community, means that the location of the monuments was not chosen due to this. It is more likely that Grant Park was chosen because of reasons more personal to the Fund. The monuments take the forms of two Native American warriors in combat with each other. They are nude, other than their head-dresses and hold a spear and bow respectively. They sit on pedestals but are both individually seventeen feet tall. The statues are constructed out of bronze, but it is not clear why Mestrovic chose such a material. However, upon further research, bronze was highly used by sculptors during the “Art-Deco” era, which had reached its peak in the early twentieth century. Bronze was popular in places such as France, and Mestrovic had studied in Paris; he may have further continued that practice when constructing sculptures for the United States.

#### "REBEL ARCHIVE"
The Bowman and the Spearman have come under fire for generalizing and misrepresenting indigenous tribes. In particular, the tribes which resided and currently reside the Chicagoland area. These groups have been around for thousands of years. They arrived in Illinois around twelve thousand years ago and were abundant when settlers first reached the land. Tribes in the Chicagoland area included the Sauk, the Kickapoo, and the Potawatomi. However, after years of combat with the colonists, in addition to disease and other factors, these tribes faced a decline in population as their cultures were stripped away. Many found themselves being displaced and murdered. They were consistently othered by white Americans. As shown through the Bowman and the Spearman, they were depicted as angry and violent. These statues immortalize such a perception, as Mestrovic displays two indigenous warriors acting aggressively towards each other by way of weapons. They were also depicted as primitive, a concept agreed upon by many Americans at the time. These warriors are nude, despite many indigenous people, especially in Chicago, being fully clothed in the 1920s. Many wore clothes that were typical for white Americans at the time, as they were forced into residential schools and made to follow American culture as children. Most of them did not attend these schools voluntarily- instead they were kidnapped, often by the U.S. government. In Illinois, children from the Standing Rock Reservation, amongst others, were often sent to Saint Mary’s Training School. Like many residential schools, many children would not survive. By keeping the statues nude, they remained unfamiliar and strange to passerby, and the inaccurate depiction kept them from connecting to the indigenous. While Calvin Coolidge had announced that Native Americans were citizens of the U.S. in 1924, two years before construction, Mestrovic and Americans still perceived the indigenous as incredibly different from themselves (Native Voices). The statues depict these people almost as belonging of the colonial times.

#### COUNTER-MONUMENT
When designing the counter-monument, it was imperative to consider the outdated and inaccurate representation of Mestrovic’s sculptures. A counter-monument would have portrayed indigenous people in a powerful pose, but still veering away from an aggressive one. When speaking of indigenous people, if not depicting them as violent and angry, some people generalize them as “noble savages” or purely peaceful people helpless against the colonists. In reality, Native Americans did engage in physical fights against the settlers. By thinking of them as entirely helpless, one takes away their agency and erases any achievements that the indigenous may have accomplished against their enemies. However, it was also important to keep their pose relatively neutral. Mestrovic’s statues, by holding weapons, are in positions that insinuate battle and violence, which are two words that may also be associated with indigenous people. Thus, poses which depicted indigenous people interacting, but not through conflict, (while not hinting at fear), was one of the goals set for this monument. The intention was to not make the weapons as visible, in order to maintain the idea that most  indigenous people are not violent without cause. Keeping the statues’ attire timeless was also desirable. Rather than the stereotypical and outdated clothing, as showed in Mestrovic’s statues, clothing traditional to Native American tribes such as the ones from the Council of Three Fires (indigenous to Chicago) would have been sculpted. Ideally, a piece of clothing or a pattern from most tribes-if not all- would have been carved. Thus, many tribes would have seen a part of their culture and tradition represented. In addition, passersby would have been able to see a variety of different cultures in one monument. Due to this, they could have grown curious over the origins of particular aspects and indulged in research that increased broader understanding of the tribes in the Chicago-land area. The currency of issues facing indigenous people, specifically in Chicago, would have also been depicted through these clothes, as they would not have solely belonged to a single time period. Simultaneously, visitors to the statues would have been reminded of the past, as these clothes would have been more common earlier in time. Symbols would have been placed on the pedestal of the statue as well. As remembering the indigenous tribes of Chicago is the overall purpose of the monument, these symbols would be directly from them. One such symbol would be an eagle, or an eagle feather, which is of great importance to the Potawatomi tribe, as it is believed that these scared birds “deliver messages and prayers to the creator” (Potawatomi).  Another symbol would have been a wolf, which is prominent in an Ojibwe story, in which a wolf and the first man explored the world together, subsequently naming everything on the planet. According to Ojibwe folklore, wolves also instructed humans on how to survive (NorthernWilds). Usually, they are considered symbols of perseverance to the Ojibwe (Williamson, 26). These symbols would represent animals and objects important to indigenous life in Chicago and would be another way in which many tribes would be represented, rather than one or two.
