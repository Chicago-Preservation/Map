#### MONUMENT
The Illinois Centennial Monument stands as a commemoration to the 100th anniversary of Illinois, celebrating its arts, agriculture, and industry. However, it also depicts early European-Indigenous contact through a binary lens that reinforces colonial narratives. The monument portrays Indigenous figures in stereotypical attire, juxtaposed with heroic representations of white colonizers, perpetuating a distorted version of history. Erected in 1918 amidst a global pandemic, its construction coincided with a time when narratives of progress overshadowed the realities of displacement faced by Indigenous communities like the Sauk, Meskwaki, Potawatomi, Kickapoo, and Winnebago. Situated in Logan Square Park—a diverse area featuring modern cafés and markets—the monument’s imposing 68-foot marble column echoes the dominance of colonial power structures. This contrast creates a critical examination of the historical erasure of marginalized voices, linking past injustices to contemporary struggles for recognition and equity in a city that claims progress while often forgets its Indigenous roots.

The Centennial is celebrated by depicting the state of Illinois as Ceres, the ancient Roman goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility, and motherhood. By placing Ceres at the center of the monument, the engraving contributes to a wrongful portrayal of the social and cultural history of Illinois. The use of Eurocentric imagery reinforces white supremacist ideals and neglects the resistance and existence of the Indigenous nations of Illinois.

At the top of the 75 foot-high Doric column that is known as the Illinois Centennial Monument lies a 10 foot bald eagle. Eagles have been used as the US-American nation symbol for the creation of a homogeneous national identity that has privileged the voices of white settlers. This stylistic choice not only reflects ideals of freedom and strength from a very biased angle but also perpetuates a narrative that often overlooks the complex histories and contributions of of Indigenous nations such as the Sauk, Mesquakie, Potawatomi, Kickapoo, and Winnebago, native to Illinois.

The base of the Illinois Centennial Monument features a circular carving by artist Evelyn Beatrice Longman. In this carving, we see the depictions of Ceres, Daniel Boone, and Hiawatha. The problematic aspect of this depiction is the misrepresentation of Hiawatha, who was an important figure for the Iroquois Confederation but never set foot in the Illini Confederation. In contrast, Black Hawk was a prominent figure in the Sauk Nation, known for opposing the validity of Quashquame's Treaty of St. Louis and for protecting Indigenous lands.

Featuring a white-European woman as the center of the Illinois Centennial Monument and giving her the symbol of the state of Illinois diminishes the importance of Indigenous women in the history of the United States. Indian Madonna is a picture taken by Illinois artist Benjamin A. Gifford. Recognizing and honoring the contributions of women and particularly indigenous women is essential for a more inclusive understanding of Illinois's heritage.


#### Counter Monument 
>
When contesting the Illinois Centennial Monument, two key issues come to mind: the wrongful depiction of Hiawatha and the use of European imagery throughout the monument. The base, featuring a circular carving by artist Evelyn Beatrice Longman, inaccurately portrays Hiawatha, an important figure for the Iroquois Confederation, despite his never having set foot in the Illini Confederation. In contrast, Black Hawk, a significant leader of the Sauk Nation, is overlooked, even though he fought against the validity of Quashquame's Treaty of St. Louis to protect Indigenous lands. Additionally, the central representation of a white European woman diminishes the importance of Indigenous women in U.S. history. This reliance on Eurocentric imagery not only perpetuates harmful stereotypes but also hinders the contributions of Indigenous peoples, highlighting the need for an inclusive understanding of Illinois’s heritage.

What do you know about the Illinois Centennial Monument? I began the conversation with OpenAI and the ChatGPT 4.0 version. What are the counter-narratives to this monument? This was the question that followed. As the prompts continued and the questions became more critical and specific, I noticed that ChatGPT was becoming increasingly redundant and repetitive. It struggled to go beyond terms like "colonialism," "Eurocentrism," and "settlers."

When I asked for specific examples, names, symbols, and stories, the response was limited. For instance, when I asked about including the Potawatomi, Miami, Sauk, Meskwaki (Fox), and Kickapoo Nations, as well as the Illinois (Illiniwek Confederation) Nations in the creation of a counter-monument, the model assumed this meant the new monument had to resemble the Illinois Centennial Monument. This was challenging, especially after I had repeatedly used terms like "counter-narrative," "different," "opposite," and "against."

When I asked for specific meanings and symbolism, the responses were overly general, focusing on natural resources like trees, feathers, animals, and spirits—symbols that are mainstream and to an extent stereotypical of Indigenous Nations."

A counter-monument to the Illinois Centennial Monument should challenge the history and biases that this original monument embodies. To go beyond these biases, we must revise the narrative we have been told and listen to the voices of those who were here long before the settlers arrived—specifically, the Sauk, Meskwaki, Potawatomi, Kickapoo, and Winnebago peoples.

The counter-monument should incorporate their stories and perspectives, reflecting their rich history. The existing white monument, designed in a traditional European style, fails to represent the diversity and vibrancy of the land that is now Illinois. My aim would be to disrupt the whiteness of this monument—both literally and symbolically.

This new monument would serve as both a celebration and a memorial, honoring the fact that Indigenous peoples in Illinois are still present and that their history endures, even though their voices have often been misrepresented or overlooked in mainstream narratives.
