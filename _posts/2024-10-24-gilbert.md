#### MONUMENT
"The Republic" Monument in Chicago, also known as the Statue of The Republic, is a historic landmark located in Jackson Park. It was originally created for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the Americas. The World Columbian Exposition, also known as the Chicago World Fair, was a monumental showcase of culture, industry, technology, and global influence of the West. It marked America as a global power, and emphasizes American ideals and values of what the future should look and feel like. The statue was designed by American sculptor Daniel Chester French, who is also known for his work on the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. The fair left a lasting influence which can be seen through the creation and legacy of The Republic, that Daniel Chester French created as it influenced city planning and design through the Beaux-Arts style, which emphasizes symmetry and grandeur. The original statue was 65 feet tall, made of gilded plaster, and stood in front of the Grand Court of Honor during the Exposition. However, it was dismantled after the fair, and in 1918, a smaller bronze replica was erected on the site to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Exposition. This version stands about 24 feet tall and symbolizes the themes of democracy, liberty, and civic pride. 

The shape of the monument is of a woman, upright and tall, looking forward with a face of defiance and determinism signifying power, authority, and an enduring national spirit. She has both arms raised up in the air, the right arm holding a scepter that is crowned with an eagle, which symbolizes the United States. In her left hand, she is holding a globe which symbolizes global influence and control. It also has a connotation with the United States holding a status of world power and its aspirations towards imperialism and expansionism of influence. She is wearing a crown, which could be a symbol of regalness which has meaning towards a sense of impurity, pureness, and legacy. She is wearing draped clothing which appears to be of greco-roman clothing. The form of the statue is heavily influenced by classical Greek and Roman art with the way in which she is presented has an aesthetic that resembles goddesses. The statue is made up of bronze, and a passerby can immediately tell by a simple glance of the statue. The entirety of the standing statue is bronze except for the base, which is composed of stone that serves as a pedestal. The utilization of bronze holds a lot of symbolic meaning, particularly as representative of power. Bronze throughout history has a direct connotation with strength and stability and the statue, which stands tall, is certainly representative of that. There is no shortage of visibility of power and resilience within this statue, and it does a great job at serving as a time capsule for the Exposition. Bronze also equates to permanence and growth, which are central ideals and values of America. As for the historical context, the bronze of the statue also makes a connection with ancient Greek usage of bronze and statues, serving as a link to how we as America view and value ancient Greek as the house on the hill, and how the American republic is representative and a mirror for democracies of the past that we value and look back at for inspiration and knowledge. The pedestal of the statue is made up of stone which, when looking at the symbolism and the history of when this monument was created, makes a lot of sense. The use of stone provides an enduring foundation which acts as a symbol for stability. Stone has also been seen as a natural and eternal material, which connects itself to the earth and the natural landscape. This was most likely intentional, as the creator of the monument wanted to make an announcement that the beliefs and values of the Republic are fundamental and enduring. The statue is an emblem of ideas related to colonialism and the broader theme of an idealization of American progress and achievement.

The intended meaning of The Republic Monument was to symbolize American ideals of liberty, democracy, and national unity, especially as they were celebrated during the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The form, symbols, and intended meaning are representative of American imperialism and expansionism, subtly asserting the United States' control and power over other nations. The statue, both consciously and unconsciously, reflects a belief in U.S. supremacy, its shiny surface embodying this theme. By focusing solely on grandeur and power, the statue fails to acknowledge the inequality and exploitation underlying the nation's rise.

#### "REBEL ARCHIVE"
The Statue of the Republic, symbolizing liberty and democracy, overlooks the harsh realities of 19th-century Chicago, where inequality, dangerous living, and working conditions was a central theme in the lives of immigrants and vulnerable populations. The “White City” of the World Columbian Exposition presented an idealized version of the era, masking and hiding the exploitation that was involved in creating the city. Designed by a white elite, the statue reflects a colonial, Eurocentric perspective that influenced not only the fair but also the future of architecture and public monuments. This legacy positioned white European ideals as the pinnacle of human achievement and success. 

In 1867, George Pullman founded the Pullman Palace Car Company, quickly dominating the railroad passenger car industry. By 1880, he established a company town in Pullman, Illinois, to house his workers. Initially celebrated for improving worker conditions, Pullman’s reputation became tinted during the 1893 economic downturn. He laid off workers and slashed wages without reducing rent or utilities in his town. In response, Pullman workers went on strike in 1894 which led to a national boycott that consisted of violent clashes. This archival image acknowledges and highlights the disparity of the “White City” of the World Columbian Exposition and the real Chicago that was occurring outside of the White City.

This archival image showcases the obvious disparity and relationship between worker and employer. Harper’s Weekly, a magazine of the people, was known for its detailed engravings and illustrations, which provided visual commentary on the events of the time, making it especially influential in an era before widespread photography. In the 1880s, the Knights of Labor, alongside political radicals and reformers, led a national movement demanding an eight-hour workday and in May 1886, 35,000 Chicago workers went on strike and protested, ultimately turning violent and deadly. Eight men were convicted without evidence for the deaths and violence due to their political views that were in favor of labor equality. They were eventually pardoned but the incident as a whole damaged the labor movement significantly. 
The incident damaged the labor movement significantly. The image captures the essence of the cruelness of being a worker in the late 19th century, especially when compared to the “White City” that the Columbian Exposition attempted to portray as an idealized version of the period.

#### COUNTER-MONUMENT
The intended design for representing ‘The Statue of The Republic’ as a counter-monument was to create an image that demonstrated the issues that made up the gilded age. It was important more than anything to highlight the life of the political radicals and labor leaders who were attempting to organize and fight for safer working conditions as well as higher pay and better living. The Republic, created for and showcased at the Chicago World Fair, symbolized an idealized representation not only of the city of Chicago and of its creation but also a false representation of the United States as the pinnacle of living and existing. The Statue of the Republic overlooks the harsh realities of 19th-century Chicago, where inequality, dangerous living, and working conditions was a central theme in the lives of immigrants and vulnerable populations. The “White City” of the World Columbian Exposition presented an idealized version of the era, masking and hiding the exploitation that was involved in creating the city. To combat this narrative, I attempted to Create an image of a counter-monument of ‘The Republic’ that keeps the original statue but it needs to showcase the effects of the gilded age in regards to the strikes and riots that workers were pushed into as they attempted to create and organize these strikes to bring national attention to the working conditions and complaints of their livelihoods. The counter-monument should showcase symbols representative of the riots and strikes of The Haymarket affair. These symbols should include depictions of a worker or workers being beaten and injured, as well as their defiance in the midst of chaos by having symbols that feature fiery speeches from political radicals and labor leaders, highlighting the peaceful gatherings of the workers in contrast to the police and the employer. Symbols could include signs of economic exploitation such as money as well as bullets to showcase the inherent greediness and selfishness of the employer and speeches and communal gatherings to showcase the defiance and interest of the political radicals and labor leaders in creating a more equal and safer future for themselves and their children. 

Counter-monument of ‘The Republic’ symbolizing the Gilded Age labor struggles. It acts as a form of demonstration of the ways in which the original republic monument fails to address the livelihoods of workers. This counte-monument shines a light on the laborers existence and showcases the specific barriers and hindrances on their ability to have safe working conditions and humane living conditions that is contrast of the idealized narrative that the Chicago World Fair attempted to falsely spread.

Counter-monument of The Republic: This piece captures the resilience of Gilded Age workers, blending symbols from the Haymarket affair—injured but unyielding laborers, fiery speeches from radical leaders, and peaceful gatherings watched over by police. It brings out the intense clash between workers’ hopes for a fair future and the harsh exploitation and repression they 
faced.

I encountered during the process of asking ChatGPT for an image of a counter-monument of ‘The Statue of the Republic’ that I couldn’t get ChatGPT to include the actual statue. It always gave me a radically different representation of the statue and it was difficult to discern how it came to ignore my specificity in including it. The large language model also seemed to reinterpret the gender of the statue, changing the original statue from a tall and fierce looking woman into a man. I found this shocking as I never asked it to do that and I inferred that this was occurring because when thought of the “average” image of a statue, it has typically been an honoring of a man or men and therefore the AI eradicates the woman and inserts a man to be front and center. I found that ChatGPT wouldn’t give me any imagery of a worker being beaten or visibly hurt. It seemed to surpass that language by instead including fire and weapons. I ensured to include this imagery in the prompt and yet again it gave a simpler, more digestible version of what I was asking for. The fact that it couldn’t demonstrate this request is disappointing because it is supporting an idealized narrative of history that dismisses and ignores the honest stories of the workers and treats their truth as unimportant and too uncomfortable to be accurately presented. In response, I think about the human condition in regard to pain and the difficult stories that we as human beings do not like to acknowledge. Part of the comfortability of these representations and imagery is that it offers a different narrative than the one we are used to and it demands accountability which is difficult to process and accept. ChatGPT offers a more beautified version of Haymarket Affair and the actual experiences of the workers during the Gilded Age and therefore these images do not sufficiently paint the picture of a counter-monument that truly gets at the issues at hand. Even when giving a very specific and detailed response, the imagery and content that AI creates most of the time gave an image absent of crucial and meaningful details that deserved to be highlighted and yet were left out of the counter-monument. This points to the way in which these large language models are trained in creating an average and the average is a narrative that does not offer the full, rounded picture and this is excruciatingly difficult to contend with when human beings begin to use AI to understand their history and allow it to shape their future.
