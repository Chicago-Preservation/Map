 >Although the University of Southern California (USC) Village was designed and developed to promotes academic excellence while also enhance the surrounding community on and around University Park Campus⁠, when understood as a historical representation of utopia or reprieve from what occupied the space prior, it embodies gentrification and, in turn, displacement (Los Angeles City Planning, 2010: 1).

In 1894, USC’s surrounding neighborhood consisted of a random assortment of wood-framed, single-family houses with no uniformed setbacks and little to no regulations on the land (Fig. 1). Not planned as a subdivision, some dwellings were up against the street, some were pushed back, some had small outhouses or private windmills and tanks (Fig. 1ab). As outlined by Cuff’s The Provisional City and Nicolaides’ “Where the Working Man Is Welcomed”: Working-Class Suburbs in Los Angeles, 1900-1940, the dispersion and in consistency of these dwellings suggest they could be temporary, self-built shacks (Cuff, 2001: pg. 35; Nicolaides, 1999: pg. 544). The working-class built their single-family shacks on their lots over time from salvaged materials. The farther the dwellings were from the street, the more insubstantial they were. Though “not comfortable accommodations”, they provided “livable” housing to this demographic of low income laborers (Cuff, 2001: 35). According to the map’s key, the scattered dwellings were “building, not special” while the main university building was a special, brick building with metal cornice and a stone front (Fig. 1ab).
>
By 1907, there was a noticeable shift in the neighborhood’s surrounding fabric. In clearly planned subdivisions, the dwellings had little variation and regularized setback lines (Fig. 2). What once was a collection of three official university buildings, including a boarding dormitory, founded on relatively vacant land (Fig. 1), has branched out into gymnasiums and athletic fields surrounded by specialized woodworking, printing, and dressmaking shops; plumbing and electricity facilities; and hardware stores and bakeries (Fig. 2). 
>
Despite the original campus remaining the same size for forty years after being founded in 1880, the existence of USC has projected an ever changing vision of modernity in the public imagination (Elkus, 2010: 3). Over time, the original self-built shacks were completely replaced by regularized subdivisions (Fig. 3, and 4abc). Continual processes of civic upheaval in terms of Dana Cuff’s The Provisional City is demonstrated repeatedly as homeplaces were replaced by USC buildings and commercial stores (Fig. 5, 6, and 7). The University facility expansion was described as “multiple growth phases and enhancements” by the Los Angeles Department of City Planning (2010). However, to Nicolaides’ the changes represented a space “where the working man is [no longer] welcomed”. Processes of erasure come into play as tenants are displaced to make room for students and faculty. Thus, the piecemeal additions conveyed a provisionality of urban evolution in Los Angeles that accentuated the University’s historical representation as a utopia or reprieve from past structures (Cuff, 2001: 5). 
>
From an original campus totaling 7.5 acres, the USC Village—completed in 2017—alone is more than 28 acres (Elkus, 2010: 3; Krieger, 2014). The local stores of the 1970s as seen in Fig. 5, 6, and 7 as well as the past University Village’s cinema, shops, and restaurants have been replaced with Target, Trader Joe’s, Cava, Bank of America,...etc. (Fig. 8) (Di Rado, 2017). An estimated 580 thousand square feet of existing uses were removed to implement the USC Village (Los Angeles City Planning, 2010). Claiming to “revolutionize the landscape of the university and neighborhood”, city planners promised community benefits in the form of wider sidewalks, renovated roads, pedestrian and bike-friendly crosswalks and lanes, and more trees (Krieger, 2014). Strikingly, however, the ability to invest on such a large-scale into a previously disinvested community substantiates Pulido’s argument of white privilege (Pulido, 2000: 17). That said, the sense of affluence and eminence from the Collegiate Gothic architecture intended to blend into the University’s existing architecture alienates the low-income community it is meant to serve (Will, 2018).

Even the proposed utopia can be “naive to its own vulnerability to the next generations dreams” (Cuff, 2001: 5). Perhaps we should ask which communities are most likely to be displaced next and what can we do?
