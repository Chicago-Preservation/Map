#### MONUMENT
The William McKinley Monument, located in McKinley Park on the Southwest Side of Chicago, was erected in 1905 to commemorate the 25th president of the United States, William McKinley. Sculpted by Charles J. Mulligan, the monument consists of a bronze statue of McKinley standing atop a large granite pedestal, in keeping with the neoclassical style typical of early 20th-century monuments. McKinley is depicted in a dignified pose, exuding statesmanship and leadership, which aligns with the narrative of his presidency as one of American progress and expansionism. The monument was placed in McKinley Park, named in his honor, a popular green space designed to offer recreation to the surrounding community.

The form of the monument is grandiose, with its large scale intended to evoke respect and admiration for McKinley’s contributions to the nation. The use of bronze for the figure and granite for the pedestal were chosen for their durability and traditional associations with power, stability, and immortality—qualities ascribed to the legacy of McKinley. The monument’s location in a public park reflects the broader cultural agenda of the City Beautiful movement, which sought to uplift and inspire civic pride through monumental architecture. However, this idealized portrayal is incomplete, occluding critical aspects of McKinley’s presidency, especially in relation to his role in U.S. imperialism.

#### "REBEL ARCHIVE"
While the McKinley Monument presents an image of American leadership, the larger histories it embodies tell a more complex story, particularly in relation to the themes of coloniality and racial oppression. McKinley’s administration oversaw the expansion of American imperialism through the annexation of Hawaii, the victory in the Spanish-American War, and the subsequent acquisition of territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. His policies were part of a larger project of U.S. colonialism that prioritized economic and territorial gain at the expense of Indigenous peoples and non-white populations. The celebration of McKinley as a progressive leader through this monument ignores the violent means by which American expansion was achieved, including the suppression of independence movements in the Philippines and the exploitation of colonized peoples.

Moreover, McKinley’s legacy is linked to racialization, both domestically and internationally. His presidency occurred during a period of intense racial segregation and systemic discrimination in the United States, particularly against African Americans and Indigenous peoples. While McKinley himself did not take overt steps to combat racial injustice, his policies reinforced the racial hierarchies that justified U.S. imperialism abroad. The monument, through its grandiose form and heroic imagery, perpetuates the narrative of white American exceptionalism, erasing the experiences of those who suffered under the expansionist policies that McKinley promoted.

This postcard from McKinley Square in Adams, Massachusetts, depicts a statue of President William McKinley, commemorating his leadership and contribution to American expansionism. The statue's placement in a civic space, surrounded by American flags, symbolizes national pride and McKinley's role in shaping U.S. imperial policy. However, the monument glosses over the more controversial aspects of his presidency, including the oppression of Indigenous peoples and the expansion of U.S. power through colonization, highlighting how monuments can selectively represent historical figures.

#### COUNTER-MONUMENT

This image depicts an Indigenous community affected by U.S. expansion during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the era of McKinley’s presidency. The image illustrates the colonial violence and displacement experienced by Native populations, themes that are not reflected in the celebratory narrative of the William McKinley Monument in Chicago. The inclusion of a protest flyer and a map of American expansion further underscores the hidden histories of oppression and colonization that were integral to McKinley's policies but erased in the monument.
