> There exists a trope known as the “American Dream” in which a utopia of home ownership brews a national ethos of opportunity via their hard work. More specifically, in the case of the Flats Aliso Village, the dream of American domesticity for immigrants (predominantly Mexican and Russian in this area) was revoked through the destructive redevelopment that fuels erasure of vulnerable communities through slum clearance. Such discussion of Tabula Rasa ignites the conversation of spatial injustices and hegemonic prejudice from local officials to establish favorability on sanctioned architectural ornaments. Therefore, the examination of the relationship between Tabula Rasa and modernity elaborates methods of design that reinforce patterns of communal disruption.

> Susan Briante, author of the piece “Utopia's Ruins: Seeing Domesticity and Decay in the Aliso Village Housing Project” pinpoints how developers along with political leaders, ravaged the Flats community from existence in order to impose a different vision and erase the image of slums. Through architecture and planning,  where city officials, developers and architects such as Lloyd Wright created colonial typology via modernism. As seen above, the Flats were a collection of low-rise buildings, notably detached complexes with common Americana ornaments, that allowed for courtyards, shared commons and between 1 and 2 bedrooms. Furthermore, the Flats was a vision of the American Dream trope and was occupied mainly by low-income Mexican immigrants.

>As Dana Cuff best said in her book, The Provisional City: Los Angeles Stories of Architecture and Urbanism, “architecture also makes claims about what is not worth saving” (Cuff 41). Furthermore, even though modernity attempts to strive in progress, projects such as the Aliso Village when compared to its predecessor, The Flats, reinforce future precedents for favoring the contemporary and imposing an American style of integration on those who are not privileged. Moreover, modernity is a contemporary term for utopia, the acknowledgment for progress except without the promise of perfection which is reiterated throughout the remnants of modernism. To the image above, carely is it known that such developments targeted non-white enclaves, notably Boyle Heights Flat. Briante mentions how, “The appraiser for Aliso Village, Charles Shattuck, was the president of the California Real Estate Association and an official of the Home Owners Loan Corporation responsible for redlining neighborhoods. Shattuck and his crew condemned most of the structures in ruinous terms: ‘hardly fit for human habitation,’ ‘shacklike,’ ‘building is a wreck'’” “Flats lived in low-rise detached housing consisting of one- and two-room units with common walkways and shared bathroom facilities in house courts” (Briante p. 132). Such monolithic drawings exacerbate flatting of contextual realities, for worse, displacing and reducing the number of available units.

>Historically, minority predominant Los Angeles regions have been wiped without consideration of consent as a result of modernism plus the attempts to impose a standard that ceases slums. Proponents of housing developments and American domesticity have largely ignored the amount of upheaval and damage that has been brought, since affordable housing units have been systemically shattered and the remaining ruins of Aliso Village will continue to remind people of the tainted legacy of pursuing modernist Utopian promises that manifested only to failed down the line. To the left it is seen how The Flats is being lifted into its 3rd flattening with the introduction of Pueblo del Sol. architecture be complicit in the demise of communities and uphold hegemony through utopian visions to modernist to contemporary.
