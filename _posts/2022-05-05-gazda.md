Throughout the 19th century, Chavez Ravine was a picturesque area of hills and valleys just north of the business sector of Los Angeles. As the new century dawned, Los Angeles quickly developed into a metropolis, offering high-rise apartments, office buildings, paved streets, and electricity. No such investments were made in Chavez Ravine. While the Ravine remained rural and unincorporated next to a growing metropolis, the residents built a close-knit, self-sufficient community.

Land was initially purchased in the area by Julian Chavez, a settler from New Mexico who wanted to use it for “agricultural purposes” in the 1830s (Laslett 2015, 21). During the smallpox epidemics in 1850 and 1880, Chavez Ravine acted as a “pest farm” to care for the Mexicans and Chinese who suffered from the disease. The Ravine became to be seen by middle-class whites as a remote and inhospitable area to which undesirable immigrants could conveniently be assigned (Laslett 2015, 21).

Carol Jacques, a resident of the ravine, especially remembered how colorful the church ceremonies were in Palo Verde (one of the subbarrios of the Ravine) compared to the more sober services held in Silverlake (Laslett 2015, 25). On the walls of many houses were old family photographs and calendars with colorful pictures depicting la Virgen de Guadalupe and Jesucristo Laslett 2015, 7).

A big reason the ravine appealed to its inhabitants was its rural atmosphere and natural beauty. “Each of Chavez Ravine’s subbarrios was nestled in a separate canyon surrounded by meadows, clumps of trees, [and] flowering bushes.” (Laslett 2015, 17). The unfenced surroundings of the ravine provided a great playground for children, allowing them to pursue childhood adventures without encountering traffic or the LAPD. The steep hillsides of Chavez Ravine helped to protect its residents from nativist whites and “other outsiders who despised the immigrants’ poverty and made fun of their “quant” way of life.” (Laslett 2015, 20). 

Between World War I and the Great Depression, the barrio still lacked most elements of modern urban infrastructure. But “the intimacy of its neighborhood life and the uniqueness of its geography created an organic, self-made community with a strong sense of place and of pride in its own identity and traditions.” (Laslett 2015, 39). The quality of houses in the ravine varied considerably, depending on their age and the resources of the families who owned them. About 1/4 of the homes were well-built, constructed out of standard building materials. Unfortunately, the third of the houses that were in poor condition caught the public eye, leading the neighborhood to be labeled as “substandard.” (Ronald 2005, 165). 

In the Postwar Era, the politicians planning L.A.’s future had a plan: to transform L.A. from a commercial center into a modern, industrial metropolis capable of taking its place alongside New York and Chicago as one of America’s foremost cities (Laslett 2015, 55). The idea of corporate modernism triumphed in LA Mayor Poulson’s election -- a head of one of the city’s oldest architectural firms described their development plans as “the devotion of the urban core to large banking interests . . . [and] large government centers, with all of their support buildings.” (Laslett 2015, 56). New residential housing was to be confined largely to the suburbs, with private builders attracting lower-class home buyers to the outskirts by reducing the per-unit cost of house building through standardized production techniques.

“Many saw a Major League Baseball franchise as an economic stimulus and as a prestigious status symbol for modern Los Angeles.” - Don Parson

Walter O’Malley, the owner of the Dodgers, had a particular vision for the stadium: futuristic architecture, tram transportation, and water features. The stadium had Mid-Century modern architectural details in particular, such as its 1960s pastel color palette, inverted canopies, and a folded metal roof (Los Angeles Conservancy, year unknown). The promise of an improved quality of life for the residents of Chavez Ravine was what developers used as their argument to excavate the area. They cited the dilapidated housing structures and the poverty that was seen by the public eye. In a 1943 article in the Architectural Forum, a city planner asked, “How can we fix decay? The way a dentist does— by cleaning out the infected area and guarding it against further trouble.” (Parson, 2005, 18, 26.) The promise of modern infrastructure that would bring in lots of profit was ultimately the reason the entire community of Chavez Ravine was destroyed - covered up as “urban renewal”.

Pictured is an 1884 real estate map of Los Angeles, zoomed into Chavez Ravine. As shown, the Santo Nino Church was one of the most important buildings in the community, as attending church and Catholic traditional events was central to the community’s culture. Knowing how rural the community was, it makes sense that the houses are clearly spread out on the map. This contributed to the Ravine being viewed as old and not up to modern standards by L.A. developers. Source: The Map Collection - Los Angeles Public Library.

As pictured, Chavez Ravine was a hilly, small, close-knit community with a rural atmosphere. The houses were pretty spread out as many residents raised pigs, goats, and chickens. The houses appear to  be in good condition, with electricity and tree-lined streets. 1951. Source: the Photo Collection, Los Angeles Public Library.

After the demolition and flattening of Chavez Ravine, Dodger Stadium was built in its place, with the parking lot taking up most of the area. The Stadium encompasses Mid-Century Modern Architecture, a sharp contrast to the rural community it ate up. Many saw the building of this stadium as a prestigious status symbol for modernizing Los Angeles.
