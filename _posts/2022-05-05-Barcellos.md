> The Post-World War II Ranch Home had as much cultural influence as it did architectural. The “Pace Setter” house, a specific ranch variation, and its designers Cliff May and Elizabeth Gordon, began to redefine the American home through its design and cultural marketing. Initially dubbed as the “After the War” home, the Pace Setter was marketed through the architectural magazine House Beautiful as the home all Americans could live in, after the war. Most different about the cultural push for the Pace Setter is how intimate it depicts the relationship between the house and the social, or family. The Pace Setter, and the architectural discourse surrounding it, in part worked to create the idea of a modern “home”, rather than a house. In a blurb written for House Beautiful about the Pace Setter, Gordon writes that readers should “visualize the social values that such a house represents. For houses and people are inseparable.” (Gordon, 1948) Immediately problematic about the idolization of the Pace Setter for all American families is the financial barrier that prevented most people from making it their home. It is particularly evil to create a model home that cannot be obtained by the same families trapped in the “model home” thinking, but the universally obtainable lessons the house projects were created in part to abdicate people like Elizabeth Gordon from marketing false hope. That said, the design of the Pace Setter home creates a domestic sphere where the labor of housewives is simultaneously admired and disrespected. 
> The layout of the kitchen is most instructive about the domestic politics of the Pace Setter house. The kitchen and dining room are two of the first things visitors and family members see when they enter, and once in the dining room, there is nothing inhibiting the view of the kitchen, and thus the labor of housewives in it. It allows visitors and family members to automatically recognize what does and ought happen in the kitchen: women work. This reinforces their role as domestic laborers through constant reminders. The open layout of the kitchen also allows housewives to see what is happening in other parts of the house, for the maintenance of order beyond the kitchen is also their job. Importantly, the kitchen layout allows others to see but not act in the domains they are not responsible for. For husbands, that is the kitchen, and for women, that is nowhere besides perhaps the study, which is isolated from the rest of the house. 
> The second biggest part of the Pace Setter design is its emphasis on privacy. This manifests in the many “private spaces” (Porch, Garden Room, Bedroom Patio, Living Room), meant to signify the ability to exist socially in a private context, only achievable by a certain level of affluence. The Pace Setter represented a larger shift in American life away from public spaces and towards private ones, and its ability to recreate the “public” privately demonstrates the perceived importance of family unit rather than community.
> The Pace Setter name is meant to signify the ideal trajectory of American architecture, but it also hints at the role of housewives in its design: to set the pace.
