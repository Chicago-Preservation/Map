> Single and small multi-family public housing projects built in the 1930s-1950s coupled with subsequent racialized housing covenants of the 1950s, forced Black communities to remain in South Central Los Angeles after economic opportunities dissipated, preventing the relative accumulation of wealth through property, and eventually contributing  to the over policing of marginalized neighborhoods. The “garden city” model of  public housing projects ultimately was unable to achieve its intended goals, because its success relied heavily on the continued investment in its upkeep. As popular political ideologies and economic opportunities shifted, federal money was removed from public housing projects, and transferred into community surveillance measures such as increased policing and incarceration.

> From the 1920s-1940s, the west coast, and Los Angeles in particular experienced what is known as the Great Migration, which refers to the influx of African American immigrants migrating from the economically stagnant and racially segregated south in search of economic opportunities. Furthermore, at the onset of WWII Los Angeles became a central site of building wartime infrastructure which led to an increase in employment opportunities. These new job attracted further immigration. This prompted the funding of temporary housing projects to be made available for mostly Black laborers and their families during WWII in what is now known as South Central Los Angeles. After the war was finished, the “temporary” houses were converted into subsidized housing (Historic Resources Survey Report Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan Area, 2012, 7.)

> The Avalon Garden Project and El Pueblo del Rio are two examples of public housing projects built using the popularized “Garden City” model. Which while utopian in theory, this model ultimately did not meet its goal in practice due to lack of government investment overtime. Both Avalon Garden Project and el Pueblo del Rio, designed by famous architect  Paul Revere William, were built in 1941 and inspired by the reform movements of the day.  Sir Ebenezer Howard’s “Garden City” model included common green spaces, superblock city planning and the separation of pedestrian walkways from car roads. The garden city model as demonstrated in photographer Julias Shulman in figure 1 was created in order to prevent rural flight of urban residents by creating an ultimate ideal balance between rural and urban lifestyles, and emphasized values of organization and self control. Figure 2 demonstrates the type of utopian community garden cities like Rio del Pueblo aimed to create, but were ultimately unable to sustain.

> While these garden cities were ideal public housing projects in theory, in practice, their efficacy decline significantly once support for public housing dried up in the 1950s as wartime jobs began to disappear and McCarthyism’s anti-communism was popularized. Without the proper funding and loss of employment, public housing projects like el Pueblo del Rio and Avalon Garden Project began less desirable places to live. (Parson, 1983, 260). Furthermore, for the residents of these complexes, there was little opportunity to move to other areas of the city to seek new economic opportunities due to heavily segregated housing throughout Los Angeles as well as rampant economic discrimination. In public discourses, people described the residents of public housing complexes as lazy and accused them of leeching off the government and accredited the worsening conditions to lack of tenant investment in their homes (Parson, 1983, 262). These ideas further legitimized government divestment in public housing, and helped bolster ideas of Black and Latinx communities in South Central Los Angeles as being inherently more crime ridden, violent and dangerous, justifying an increase on incarceration spending.
