 >Institutional and environmental barriers posed a serious problem for public health in Macy Street District during the 1924 Los Angeles Plague. The architectural and neighborhood divides between predominantly Mexican neighborhoods and white neighborhoods left the Mexican community living in Macy Street District more susceptible to the plague due to poor housing conditions. However, these neighborhood differences were no mere coincidence. They were a result of laws and regulations which prevented Mexican-American and other people of color from enjoying necessary and adequate infrastructure. These early differences in environmental inequality were arranged and perpetuated by zoning laws in the 1920s. These laws resulted in the concentration of industrial activity in nonwhite and immigrant communities (Pulido, Laura:26.) Mexican and industrial activity were pushed east of the Central Plaza towards the Los Angeles River while affluent whites moved into suburban areas like Pasadena, Bel Aire and Beverly Hills. Mexican Americans were forced to live in neighborhoods which are unsafe and under-resourced. Macy street district, depicted by the site boundaries in figure 1 is situated in the heart of an industrial district.

 >The Clara Street neighborhood in Macy Street District was known for its violence, overcrowding and overall unfit living environment. Manure and trash was regularly dumped and left to rot in the sun which created a breeding ground for flies. Packing houses with sheep and hog corrals along with the smell and smoke from the gas plant made the district an “unfortunate residence'' (Commission of Immigration and Housing of California 1916:229). On Lyon street, up to seven people were living in a single room with no beds. On Clara street up to five people slept on one single bed (Commission of Immigration and Housing of California 1916:250). Residents of the site boundaries depicted in figure 1, were to make due with the resources and infrastructure they had despite the causes of their material condition. The limitations of these historical conditions and design of homes for Mexicans and Mexican Americans perpetuated the deteriorating environmental conditions for these communities. In contrast, the typical Southern California home, outside of the site boundaries, was characterized by spacious bungalows with open space, vegetation, palm trees as depicted in figure 2.

 >Increased investment in white suburbs allowed for these neighborhoods to have increased opportunities and resources/infrastructure such as clean and spacious parks. White typicality including homes and neighborhoods became associated with cleanliness and order especially due to Americanization programs which encouraged assimilation and valued “cleanliness.” Historical investment in the communities and the “visual construction of regional idioms” encouraged additional investment, tourism and settlement in white suburbs (Deverall, William: 174). This in turn perpetuates the differences between affluent neighborhoods and neighborhoods such as Macy Street District with a predominantly Mexican population. “Ethnocentric blame…and assertions of white supremacy over supposed Mexican typicality” crept into legal documents and reasonings for the plague outbreak (Deverell, William: 180). Differences in physical environment between Mexican and white neighborhoods allowed for racial stereotypes to fuel displacement projects. The clearance of homes in Macy Street District were justified on the basis of cultural disposition and not the environmental barriers which allow for unlivable conditions for communities of color to persist.
