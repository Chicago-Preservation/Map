#### About
>
“Mapping Chicago Preservation” is a digital platform of map-searchable historic preservation resources for the Chicago region. By integrating data, resources, and geospatial visualization, the website seeks to facilitate collaboration and democratize access to Chicago's architectural heritage and preservation resources. The platform transforms traditionally siloed preservation documentation into an accessible, searchable digital repository by aggregating and georeferencing data from multiple preservation authorities, cultural institutions, and historical archives across Chicago. The integration of technical documentation, historical records, and preservation status information within a unified geographic interface enables new forms of spatial analysis and historical inquiry, while making these valuable resources accessible to communities, organizations, and preservation advocates who have historically faced barriers to accessing such information.
>
The platform aims to serve multiple constituencies while advancing critical discourse around equity and representation in historic preservation. For architectural historians and preservation scholars, it provides opportunities to examine the spatial distribution of landmarked properties and analyze how preservation priorities have historically reflected social power structures. As a pedagogical resource, it enables students to engage with primary source materials and develop data-driven insights into preservation policy and practice. For community organizations and preservation advocates, the platform's intuitive map interface and comprehensive database provide tools to better understand, document, and advocate for local architectural heritage. 

#### Site Navigation
>
You can use the map to explore, by zooming in, panning, and selecting "sites," which will bring up a pop-up window with information on the site's name/date/location/architect. You can also use the legend located on the bottom of the map to turn on/off map layers, organized by content and theme.
>
Or, you can use the dropdown menu located on the upper right corner of the map to go directly to a specific page.

#### Note
>
Mapping Chicago Preservation is an evolving digital humanities project aimed at democratizing access to historic preservation resources. We recognize that digital platforms require ongoing maintenance, updates, and sustainable infrastructure, yet resources for long-term preservation and accessibility remain a challenge across digital humanities initiatives.
>
While we strive to maintain accuracy and relevance, this platform is a work in progress. Some datasets may be incomplete or require updates over time, and we welcome feedback, collaboration, and contributions to enhance the project’s longevity.
>
Our goal is to advance equitable access to preservation knowledge while remaining mindful of the inherent challenges in sustaining digital resources. We appreciate your understanding as we continue to refine and expand this platform.
