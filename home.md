#### About
>
“Anti-Monumental” seeks to critically evaluate Chicago’s controversial monuments, and to propose corrective augmentations or new models that better represent the complicated history of race, conquest, and representation in Chicago. The project responds to the Chicago Monument Commission's “racial healing and reckoning project," tasked with evaluating over 500 Chicago monuments for promoting white supremacy, mischaracterizing American Indians, glorifying supporters of slavery, or representing singular accounts of history. Though seemingly singular, each monument is entangled in complicated and far-reaching histories of exploitation, extraction, and displacement – histories without physical commemoration in the contemporary city, that this site hopes to help embed in the conversation surrounding the future of these monuments.

This site was initially developed and launched in connection with the Fall course in Public History at Lake Forest College and the HUMAN grant, a multi-year initiative to explore artifical intelligence through a humanities perspective with a particular emphasis on equity and justice.

Student projects focus on monuments selected for public discussion by the Chicago Monuments Project, including the Statue of the Republic (1918), the Christopher Columbus Monument (1892), and the Italo Balbo Monument (1934). Each project features an analysis of the monument's history and context as well as its forms, materials, and symbolisms. Students then researched "rebel archives," historical images and texts that represent the broader context surrounding that which is glorified by the monument. With this research, students engaged in conversation with Chat GPT 4.0/DALL-E to envision anti/counter-monuments that either introduced silenced narratives, or called out the acts of silencing embodied by the monuments in their singular state. Each article contains text and images representative of the monument, rebel archive, and countermonument, as well as students' reflections on using AI-image generation to envision counter-monuments. If AI's training data is reflective of a form of public, unconscious bias, its inability to envision nuance, complexity, or difficult truths (encountered through these projects) is reflective of the very issues inherent to monumental, singular representations.

Articles ("pins" on the map) have been geolocated and overlaid with layers containing information on Chicago's community areas and landmarks, to encourage relational thinking as to how public history, commemoration, and preservation overlay with the geography and demographics of the city. 

#### Site Navigation
>
You can use the map to explore, by zooming in, panning, and selecting "pins," which will bring up the article associated with that site, or by clicking on landmark areas or points, which will bring up a pop-up window with information on the site's date/location/architect. You can also use the legend located on the bottom left of this sidebar to turn on/off map layers, organized by content and theme.
>
Or, you can use the dropdown menu located on the upper left of this sidebar to go directly to a specific page. The "Browse Articles" page lists the Monuments that have been explored as projects within this first iteration of the site, and you can click on the individual name to bring up the article that is also associated with a pin on the map.
