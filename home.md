title: "The Hidden Layers of Los Angeles' Domestic Landscapes"
---

#### About
> This site explores the hidden layers of Los Angeles, through a "thick map," layered with individual pins produced by students in a humanities seminar on "Domestic Speculation: Race, Gender, and the American 'Home'" at UCLA during the Spring quarter, 2022. Combining contemporary observation with historical research, students were asked to study the hidden narratives of oppression in the dominant architectures of the city, or the hidden architectures of the city oppressed by the dominant narrative. The collective project is featured here, where users are invited to explore the projects in conjunction with their conceptual framing (indicated by the categories listed on the upper left of the map) and geographic positioning in the city. Each pin provides visual and textual content on a building environment that has been occluded by historical processes of erasure and displacement. The student projects focus on topics including gentrification, racially exclusive design and cultural expression. The project on gentrification in USC village, for example, highlights changes in the Sanborn Insurance Maps of Los Angeles surrounding the college from its construction after 1894 to today. The shifting fabric helps us see gentrification not as a new issue, but as one that has roots in turn of the century visions of the city.

> This project posits that thick mapping can be expanded as a strategy for communicating silences, when produced through collective efforts in a shared space. In her scholarship on open data and participatory digital collections, Dawn Childress argues for open access frameworks to move away from the singular and authoritative and toward the inclusive and speculative. This platform, an iteration of Childress’ “Flaneur” framework for GitHub, extends from this approach. Though developed as a teaching tool for students and populated with contributions from a singular seminar, the platform is flexible and expandable, and can therefore be added to overtime with a multitude of contributions from a diversity of perspectives. 

> The project extends from the work of Kimberle Crenshaw, Katherine McKittrick, Annette Kim, Mishuana Goeman and other Critical Race, Black Feminist and Indigenous scholarship on the intersecionality of identity and racial formation with space. It begins from a critical cartography of the "redlining" maps produced by the Home Owners Loan Corporation from 1939-1940, that correlated neighborhoods with risk factors according to their racial composition. These risk factors influenced mortgage financing opportunities, creating the material deterioration to which they claimed to respond. These maps perpetuated an Anglo, heteropatriarchal imaginary in support of private property, single-family living, and the condemning of alternative conceptions of "home." This project seeks to expose the coloniality/modernity - as understood by Walter Mignolo - of domestoc reform, and to excavate alternative conceptions of the domestic from erasure or displacement.
