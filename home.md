title: "[Anti] Monumental Intelligence"
---
A series of speculative counter-narratives challenging the racism, hegemony, imperialism, and coloniality of Chicago’s controversial public history monuments.
---

#### About
>
“Anti-Monumental” works with AI to critically evaluate Chicago’s public history
monuments, and to propose corrective augmentations or new models that better
represent the complicated history of race, conquest, and representation in Chicago.
>
The project responds to the city’s commission (https://chicagomonuments.org/monuments)
the “racial healing and reckoning project, ”tasked with evaluating over 500 Chicago monuments. 
Though seemingly singular, each monument is entangled in complicated and far-reaching histories 
of exploitation, extraction, and displacement – histories without physical commemoration in the
contemporary city.
>
In conversation with an LLM, the project begins to unravel the histories underpinning monuments
central to Chicago’s public narrative, to analyze the contemporary public discourse surrounding
their preservation or plans for removal, and to connect them to alternative histories of being and belonging.
>
Sites of study include those selected for public discussion by the Chicago Monuments Project, including the monument to the Fort Dearborn Massacre (1893), The Republic (1918), a replica of the 1893 original for the World’s Columbian Exhibition, the Christopher Columbus Monument (1892), and the Italo Balbo Monument (1934).
>
Through a critical analysis of the language surrounding these public history sites, a more complicated picture will be developed than that provided by the static monument, frozen in the time of its creation and accompanied by the racist rhetoric and representations of that time. 
>
The project experiments with generative AI’s capacity for reading and producing images to question identified
monuments, and to re-envision them as “anti-monuments” to Chicago’s diverse, complicated, difficult,
and hidden histories.
