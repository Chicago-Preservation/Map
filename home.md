#### About
>
“Mapping Chicago Preservation” is a digital platform of map-searchable historic preservation resources for the Chicago region. By integrating data, resources, and geospatial visualization, the website seeks to facilitate collaboration and democratize access to Chicago's architectural heritage and preservation resources. The platform transforms traditionally siloed preservation documentation into an accessible, searchable digital repository by aggregating and georeferencing data from multiple preservation authorities, cultural institutions, and historical archives across Chicago. The integration of technical documentation, historical records, and preservation status information within a unified geographic interface enables new forms of spatial analysis and historical inquiry, while making these valuable resources accessible to communities, organizations, and preservation advocates who have historically faced barriers to accessing such information.
>
The platform aims to serve multiple constituencies while advancing critical discourse around equity and representation in historic preservation. For architectural historians and preservation scholars, it provides opportunities to examine the spatial distribution of landmarked properties and analyze how preservation priorities have historically reflected social power structures. As a pedagogical resource, it enables students to engage with primary source materials and develop data-driven insights into preservation policy and practice. For community organizations and preservation advocates, the platform's intuitive map interface and comprehensive database provide tools to better understand, document, and advocate for local architectural heritage. 

#### Site Navigation

Or, you can use the dropdown menu located on the upper right corner of the map to go directly to a specific page.
